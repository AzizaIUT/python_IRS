Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 23.25 BST Purdue Pharma and members of the multi-billionaire Sackler family, who own the company that makes the prescription painkiller OxyContin, have offered to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits from US states and cities for between $10bn and $12bn, according to a media report on Tuesday. The Connecticut-based company has been blamed for fueling the opioids crisis, which has cost the lives of more than 400,000 people across the US in the last 20 years and still kills 130 through overdoses every day, according to government figures. The potential deal was part of confidential conversations and discussed by Purdue’s lawyers at a meeting in Cleveland last week, with 10 state attorneys general and plaintiffs from some of the hundreds of cities and counties that have sued Purdue, said the report by NBC News. The news came less than a day after a judge in Oklahoma made a landmark ruling that a rival opioids maker, Johnson & Johnson via its Janssen company, had run a “false and dangerous” sales campaign that and was responsible for causing addiction and death as it drove America’s opioid epidemic in that state. Purdue had been a defendant in that case but settled in May for $270m, as did another defendant, Teva Pharmaceuticals. Johnson & Johnson chose to go all the way through trial this summer, before losing the case on Monday. The company has denied wrongdoing and said it will appeal. But Purdue and other companies, as well as a group of eight members of the Sackler family that wholly owns Purdue, still face civil court cases brought by Massachusetts, New York and numerous other states, and a multi-district case playing out in federal court in Cleveland that brings together suits by almost 2,000 US cities and counties. The first trials in that giant case in Cleveland are due to start in October and lawyers for Purdue, its owners and other companies have been in talks for months to try to hammer out a settlement. A spokeswoman for Purdue Pharma declined to comment on the details of the NBC story on Tuesday but sent a statement to the Guardian. It read: “While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals. The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now.” The statement continued: “Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.” Purdue Pharma and leading Sackler family members Richard, Beverly, Theresa, Kathe, Ilene, Mortimer Jr, David and Jonathan Sackler have vigorously denied any wrongdoing in relation to the opioids crisis. David Sackler led last week’s negotiations on behalf of the family, according to NBC. A request for comment has been submitted to representatives of the Sacklers."

But now key family members are being sued over the US opioid crisis – and their wealth and reputation are under threat Joanna Walters in New York Fri 26 Jul 2019 06.00 BST


Last modified on Fri 26 Jul 2019 16.45 BST Eight members of the billionaire Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma, the maker of the controversial opioid prescription painkiller OxyContin, are being sued by multiple American cities, counties and states. Allegations in civil lawsuits include that “eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the US opioid epidemic” – via a “deadly, deceptive … illegal scheme”. The family have long been lauded in philanthropy circles, and the Sackler name adorns top British and American museums, galleries and universities. But now their narcotics fortune, chiefly distributed via family foundations and trusts, is being shunned by a growing number of people, and despite strenuous denials of wrongdoing, their reputations and vast wealth are under threat. “They are responsible for addiction, overdose and death that damaged millions of lives,” the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, has alleged in a ground-breaking lawsuit. Another massive lawsuit filed on behalf of 600 US cities and counties across 28 states coast to coast, and eight Native American tribes, alleges: “This nation is facing an unprecedented opioid addiction epidemic that was initiated and perpetuated by the Sackler defendants for their own financial gain.” It adds that their Connecticut-based pharmaceutical firm Purdue Pharma “instructed patients and prescribers that signs of addiction are actually indications of untreated pain, such that the appropriate response is to prescribe even more opioids”. The federal government reported there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the US in 2017. The death rate increased almost threefold from 1999 to 2017, and 130 people were dying daily from opioid-related overdoses. According to various lawsuits, as owners and longtime directors of Purdue Pharma, the eight are accused of orchestrating and knowingly pushing deceptive practices at Purdue to boost sales of OxyContin while misleading prescribers and the public about the risks of addiction and death. They reaped profits while allegedly helping create “the worst drug crisis in American history,” the Massachusetts state lawsuit says. It continues: “The Sacklers had the power to decide how addictive narcotics were sold. They hired hundreds of workers to carry out their wishes, and fired those who didn’t sell enough drugs. They got more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer, than ever before [and] paid themselves billions.” The Sacklers reveal little. Forbes values this branch of the family at about $13bn. They own exclusive homes in London, New York, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons, and luxury estates in Connecticut, Texas and England. Purdue Pharma is being sued by nearly every US state. And by almost 2,000 counties and cities gathered into a historic “multi-district litigation” case in federal court in Cleveland, in which some of the complaints have been amended to include the family members alongside many corporate defendants, AKA “big pharma”. The eight Sackler individuals are also being sued personally by Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Connecticut. Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and Wisconsin are suing only Richard Sackler, and Utah is suing Richard and Kathe. The company and the family deny wrongdoing. “These baseless allegations place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis, and we deny them,” the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler families have said in a statement. And they feel “deep and profound compassion” for people struggling with addiction. Meanwhile, they are fighting the cases in court while also being involved in settlement talks. All eight are accused collectively in lawsuits of: Directing Purdue Pharma aggressively to push deceptive OxyContin marketing materials to health care providers, aimed at getting “more and more patients on Purdue’s drugs for longer and longer periods of time” at high doses. Funding the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program and “an entire degree program” at Tufts University in order, deceptively, “to influence Massachusetts doctors to use its drugs”. Against Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer and Theresa Sackler: Some pill sales representatives reported to the above directors of Purdue their concerns that certain “core” doctors were writing “inappropriate” prescriptions. But Purdue “ordered the reps to keep promoting opioids to these doctors anyway. Dozens of their patients overdosed and died.” Against Richard, Jonathan, Kathe and Mortimer: In 1999, Richard Sackler became the chief executive of Purdue and Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer were vice-presidents when the company hired hundreds of sales representatives and “taught them false claims to use to sell drugs”. Against Theresa alone: In May 2017, Purdue staff passed on advice that a reformulation of OxyContin was not a cost-effective way to prevent opioid abuse. “Theresa Sackler asked staff what they were doing to fight back to convince doctors and patients to keep using the drug.” She also served on the governance committee of Rhodes Pharma, a company owned by the Sacklers selling a generic version of OxyContin. Against Richard alone: At the launch party for OxyContin in 1996, Richard said the drug’s debut “will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition.” Amid increasing evidence of abuse of and addiction to the pills, Richard wrote in an email: “We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.” In 2007 Richard applied for the patent and monopoly for a drug to treat opioid addiction, saying opioids are addictive, and referring to “junkies”. Against Kathe alone: “As far back as the 1990s, Kathe Sackler knew that patients frequently suffer harm when high doses of an opioid are used for long periods of time.” In 2014 Purdue discussed “Project Tango”, a secret plan to sell opioid addiction treatment, for profit. Kathe and staff “wrote down what Purdue had publicly denied”: that addictive opioids and opioid addiction are “naturally linked”. They weighed becoming “an end-to-end provider”. Project Tango never went ahead. Against Mortimer David Alfons Sackler alone: When Purdue sales projections showed OxyContin sales plateauing, “Mortimer demanded answers… about why sales would not grow.” He believed the market “should grow”, one lawsuit said. When Purdue staff at one point warned the Sacklers that prescribing was falling short of expectations and the family’s quarterly payout from sales could fall from $320m to $260m, Mortimer “sharply objected and demanded answers from staff”. The first trial in any of the cases where the Sacklers personally are being sued by US local or state government is likely to be in spring 2020 in a case involving New York state and most of the state’s cities and counties and led by Suffolk county. The year 2019 emerged as a year of reckoning for the US opioid industry that had allegedly been gorging on profits: plaintiffs against the eight Sacklers multiplied; Purdue Pharma settled a case brought by Oklahoma, and the Sacklers personally contributed $75m despite not being defendants; another corporate defendant in that case, Johnson & Johnson, went to trial; Insys became the first opioid maker to declare bankruptcy after bosses were convicted in criminal court; long-secret documents in the pivotal case in Ohio revealed in July how the industry deluged an unprepared American public with dangerous pain pills. Amid settlement talks, the Ohio case – the biggest civil trial in US history – will see the first of a series of trials begin in October. Purdue Pharma was prosecuted in federal court in 2007 and fined $600m for crimes involving misleading regulators, doctors and patients about the dangers of OxyContin. The Sacklers weren’t charged, but one lawsuit notes: “The Sackler defendants voted to enter into a plea agreement that stated: ‘Purdue is pleading guilty as described above because Purdue is in fact guilty.’” US Metropolitan Museum*, Guggenheim Museum*, Dia Art Foundation; Metropolitan Opera.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 15.02 BST Pain, like death, is a universal phenomenon. The grimace on the woman’s face, registering her agony to Dr GP Dureja in his East Delhi office, would be recognized anywhere. Slouched shoulders, pinched forehead. She wore a willowy black kurta and cast a disapproving glance at the five pain physicians-in-training huddled behind Dureja, the founder of the Delhi Pain Management Centre and one of India’s pioneering pain physicians. The five trainees, participants in the center’s acclaimed pain fellowship program, recorded the woman’s consultation on their smartphones, eager to see India’s famous pain doctor do his work. After their fellowships, they will return home, to Chennai, Kashmir, Rajasthan, ready to forge careers in India’s exploding pain industry. The woman had been under Dureja’s care for some time now; he diagnosed her with fibromyalgia, a chronic neurological disorder that causes pain throughout the body. But the regimen of Paracetamol and tramadol, an opioid analgesic, was not working and she was beyond fatigued. She wanted more relief. Indians once thought of pain relief as an indulgence of the west, Dureja said after the woman left his office gripping her new prescriptions. The old way of thinking was, “‘Nobody has time to complain about pain in our country.’ But I’m getting five to seven new patients per day.” For-profit pain clinics like Delhi Pain Management Centre are opening by the score across Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and other cities in this nation of 1.3 billion people. After decades of stringent narcotics laws, borne of debilitating opium epidemics of centuries past, India is a country ready to salve its pain. And American pharmaceutical companies – architects of the opioid crisis in the United States and avid hunters of new markets – stand at the ready to fuel that demand. For Indian cancer patients who once writhed in agony, there are fentanyl patches from a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. For the country’s vast army of middle-class office workers wracked with back and neck pain, there is buprenorphine from Mundipharma, a network of companies controlled by the Sackler family, the owners of Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma. And for the hundreds of millions of aging Indians with aching joints and knees, there are shots of tramadol from Abbott Laboratories. Palliative care advocates, who recount stories of patients enduring excruciating cancer pain or dying in agony, have persuaded reluctant government officials to allow high-powered opioid painkillers into doctors’ offices and on to chemists’ shelves. But what began as a populist movement to bring inexpensive, Indian-made morphine to the ill has given rise to a pain management industry that promises countless new customers to American pharmaceutical companies facing a government crackdown and mounting lawsuits back home. The lure of a pain-free life is a revelation in a country where incomes are rising for many city dwellers and 300 million to 400 million people are approaching the middle-class. Newly-minted pain doctors promise aspiring Indians that life has more to offer in a body free from pain. “Don’t listen to your forefathers,” Dureja said, a mantra for the shifting mindset. “They said you should tolerate pain, you should not complain, you should not take painkillers. Now, everybody wants to get rid of pain early.” As major pharmaceutical companies look to capitalize on the opportunity, the playbook unfolding in India seems familiar. Earnest advocates share heartbreaking stories of suffering patients; physicians and pharmaceutical companies champion pain relief for cancer patients and persuade regulators to grant greater access to powerful opioids; well-meaning pain doctors open clinics; shady pain clinics follow; and a spigot of prescription opioids opens – first addressing legitimate medical uses but soon spilling into the streets and onto the black market. A looming deluge of addictive painkillers terrifies some Indian medical professionals, who are keenly aware that despite government regulations most drugs are available for petty cash at local chemist shops. “Are people going to figure out every trick in the game to make [opioid painkillers] widely available?” asked Dr Bobby John, a leading Indian public health expert based in New Delhi. “Of course it will happen.” The headquarters of the Pain Clinic of India operates out of a closet-size office in Chembur, a tree-lined suburb in eastern Mumbai. The company’s presence on the internet is so prominent that Dr Kailash Kothari, the clinic’s founder, has turned down requests from people in South Africa, Australia, Europe and the United States seeking prescription opioids. Down an alleyway, the clinic’s small white-red-and-blue sign is difficult to spot. Around the side of a faded-pink building is a larger sign showing a shirtless, muscular white man gripping his back, another gripping his neck, another clutching his knee; a white woman with an excruciating headache presses her forehead and another grabs her shoulder. Back Pain. Neck Pain. Headache. Knee Pain. Shoulder Pain. Cancer Pain. The sign promises “Towards Pain Free Life”. One of the principal architects of pain medicine in India, Kothari runs several clinics in Mumbai, consults at numerous hospitals and flies to his clinic in Goa once a week. He co-founded the Indian Academy of Pain, an educational branch of the Indian Society for the Study of Pain that aims to create standardized training for pain medicine. Asserting control over who can call themselves a “pain medicine doctor” in this fledgling industry is an urgent question. Spread across the subcontinent are nearly 10 million licensed physicians and a massive number of untrained medical providers. (In rural India, 70% of healthcare providers have no formal medical training.) “General practitioners have started prescribing these drugs,” Dureja said. “And we’re not educating the population on when to use and not to use.” At Dureja’s clinics, as at most medical offices in India, patients pay cash for services and prescriptions. Delhi Pain Management charges $10 for a consultation; $10 for a Johnson & Johnson fentanyl patch; $10 for a Mundipharma buprenorphine patch. Dureja’s office takes a 15% cut of sales. There are hints of American pharma’s fingerprints in a glass cabinet in the waiting room of his East Delhi clinic: awards from Johnson & Johnson honoring Dureja for symposia on pain management; a plaque for “his valuable contribution as a speaker” about tapentadol, an opioid marketed by Johnson & Johnson in 2009. The dispensing counter does a brisk business in Ultracet, branded tramadol tablets made by a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary. Each year, some 20 fellows attend Kothari’s three-to six-month training programs, and by his calculation, he has trained 150 aspiring pain doctors. “There are more than 50 people who already have their pain clinics in different parts of India,” he said. Kothari remembers when only a few hospitals in Mumbai treated cancer patients and had access to opioids. “But every year, we are accessing more of these kinds of drugs,” he said. “Many chemists, hospitals and medical shops started acquiring the licenses for keeping these drugs, and availability is much, much better. Opioids are available in not just oral, but injectable, patches, syrups.” Most large Indian hospitals have added pain management as a specialty in recent years. At the insistence of the professional societies that accredit hospitals in India, Kothari said, nurses and doctors now are required to assess pain as a fifth vital sign, along with pulse, temperature, breathing and blood pressure. The pharmaceutical industry has kept pace. Twenty years ago only a few pharmaceutical companies marketed pain medicines in India, Kothari said. “Today, almost every company is having pain management as a separate division. ” A salesman for Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker by sales, echoed the point during an interview in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab and Haryana. “Now everyone has a car, and [they get] back pain, and now they take medication.” Growing obesity rates in India were also fueling demand, he said, as patients look for relief from weight-related knee and back pain. “So the market for pain is good.” Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson did not respond to requests for comment for this report. Manmohan Singh, a vice-president at Modi-Mundipharma in New Delhi, said opioid pain medications are an important therapeutic option, especially for cancer pain. He also said company promotions stress that physicians should familiarize themselves with product safety information and the potential for adverse effects. “Patients should be made aware of the clear treatment goals related to pain and function, as well as the potential opioid side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and addiction,” he said in a written statement. The ascendance of pain management in India comes at a fortuitous political moment. Ahead of his reelection earlier this year, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, invested heavily in healthcare. Last fall, the Indian government launched the world’s biggest public health insurance program, called Ayushman Bharat. Dubbed “Modicare”, it guarantees half a billion poor Indians nearly $7,000 in hospital expenses, paid to private insurers, and, by 2020, the government is to open 150,000 primary care centers. The government has set aside $484m to fund Modi’s signature program. None of this would have been possible without the loosening of India’s strict narcotics laws. The International Narcotics Control Board, established in 1968, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1985 codified the bureaucratic thicket for any doctor who wanted to prescribe opioid painkillers. Physicians feared fines, jail sentences and losing their medical license if they skirted regulations. Dr MR Rajagopal was a young medical student in Thiruvananthapuram at the time and remembers a neighbor with advanced cancer. “I [had] seen him screaming his way over weeks to death,” Rajagopal said. “It was horrendous, and there was nothing being done about it.” He chose to become an anesthesiologist because it was the only specialty then focused on pain. Rajagopal is widely viewed as the father of palliative care in India; whispers of a Nobel prize follow him. For decades, he has worked assiduously to convince national and state lawmakers that opioid medicines are not an indulgence, but a humane refuge, and it is largely a function of his advocacy that morphine and other painkillers can be prescribed in India. “Two generations of doctors had not seen a tablet of morphine,” he said. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, as amended in 2014, recognized that the need for pain relief was “an important obligation of the government”. The revised law created a class of medicines called the “essential narcotic drugs” list, which includes morphine, fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone, codeine and hydrocodone. Rajagopal’s days are filled with the tedious work of building a movement: speaking at colleges and public forums, penning editorials and medical papers about palliative care and overseeing Pallium India, a not-for-profit medical center and training institute that is singularly focused on palliative care. Pallium’s pharmacy is a testament to Rajagopal’s persistence. Drugs once banned now fill the shelves: fentanyl injections and patches, oral morphine and, most recently, methadone, approved for pain relief in 2018. Rajagopal seems aware that one false step would invite the government to clamp down on the availability of opioids, reversing decades of his work. He does not advise using oxycodone or hydrocodone, though they are included on the “essential narcotic drugs” list, and he does not accept funding from pharmaceutical companies, instead putting his hand out to temple trustees and donations from families cared for by Pallium’s home visiting teams. But the pharmaceutical industry is a wily adversary. American activists made many of the same arguments decades ago as they sought relief for dying patients. Drugs now commonly prescribed for chronic pain were first approved for use by cancer patients. One of the first formulations of fentanyl, for example, was a lollipop because chemotherapy left cancer patients too nauseated to eat. In India, pain physicians now prescribe fentanyl patches to patients with chronic muscular pain. Purdue Pharma’s international affiliate, Mundipharma, “is very good at co-opting regulators”, said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. “As happened in the US, they are easily converted into useful idiots.” Coming tomorrow: The next opioid crisis?

First published on Mon 26 Aug 2019 21.14 BST The pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson ran a “false and dangerous” sales campaign that caused addiction and death as it drove America’s opioid epidemic, an Oklahoma court has ruled in the first judgement of its kind against the drug industry. In a damning 42-page decision, Judge Thad Balkman ruled that the company bore a wide responsibility for helping to create the worst drug epidemic in US history. He said it not only aggressively pushed false claims about the safety and effectiveness of its own narcotic painkillers, but that it changed medical practice with “deceptive” claims intended to break down caution among doctors about prescribing opioids. That included using its huge resources to fund organisations and research to promote narcotics. Balkman ordered the company to pay $572m in compensation initially with additional payments to be negotiated to cover treatment, overdose prevention and other costs of abating the epidemic in Oklahoma in the coming years. The state had asked for $17bn. Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal. The verdict is a blow to a raft of other opioid makers, distributors and pharmacy chains facing more than 2,000 other lawsuits by communities across the country, as it will undercut their attempts to pin blame for an epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades on doctors who prescribed opioids or those who used them. Oklahoma’s attorney general, Mike Hunter, said the ruling confirmed his claim that “Johnson & Johnson maliciously and diabolically created the opioid epidemic in our state”, contributing to 6,000 deaths in Oklahoma alone since 2000. “Today is a major victory for the state of Oklahoma, the nation and everyone who has lost a loved one because of an opioid overdose,” he said. “Our evidence convincingly showed that this company did not just lie and mislead, they colluded with other companies en route to the deadliest man-made epidemic our nation has ever seen.” Hunter also sued Purdue Pharma, which played a leading part in kickstarting the opioid epidemic in the 1990s with its high-strength opioid, OxyContin. Purdue settled out of court for $270m before the trial but is facing hundreds of other legal actions. Sabrina Strong, one of the trial lawyers for Johnson & Johnson, said the ruling was flawed. The company argued that the drugs it sold were approved by federal regulators and that they could not be tied directly to any deaths in Oklahoma. “We have sympathy for all who suffer from substance abuse. But Johnson & Johnson did not cause the opioid abuse crisis here in Oklahoma or anywhere in this country,” she said. But Balkman’s ruling looked at a bigger picture that dismissed the company’s attempt to portray the victims of the epidemic only as drug abusers. The judge found that the opioid maker acted in concert with other companies to escalate prescriptions by pushing the false narrative that there was a desperate need for painkillers and “there was a low risk of abuse and a low danger of prescribing opioids”. “A key element in (Johnson & Johnson’s) opioid marketing strategy to overcome barriers to liberal opioid prescribing was its promotion of the concept that chronic pain was under-treated (creating a problem) and increased opioid prescribing was the solution,” Balkman wrote. “Among other things, they sent sales representatives into Oklahoma doctors’ offices to deliver misleading messages, they disseminated misleading pamphlets, coupons, and other printed materials for patients and doctors, and they misleadingly advertised their drugs over the internet”. Opioid prescribing escalated for more than a decade until it reached a peak in 2012 of about 250m prescriptions, one for every American adult. About 18m opioid prescriptions were written in Oklahoma, a state of less than 4m people, in the three years to 2018. The judge said Johnson & Johnson also sought to influence medical practice with “substantial payments of money to a variety of different pain advocacy groups and organizations that influenced prescribing physicians and other health care professionals”. He said the company used academic findings “in deceptive ways” to downplay addiction risks. Balkman also ruled that Johnson & Johnson ignored warnings from the Food and Drug Administration and its own advisory board over its marketing methods for its high strength fentanyl drug, Duragesic, and that no data existed to back up some of the claims the company was making. The judgement said the company’s sales reps were trained to allay doctors’ concerns about addiction without requisite information on the risks. In one company memo presented in evidence at the trial, a rep said she dismissed a doctor’s fears that patients might become addicted by telling him that those who didn’t die probably wouldn’t get hooked. It was also revealed that Johnson & Johnson hired the consultants McKinsey, which recommended the company’s sales force should focus on doctors already prescribing large amounts of Purdue’s OxyContin. Among a list of “opportunities” to increase sales was a proposal to “target high abuse-risk patients (eg males under 40)”."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.03 BST What’s driving Boris Johnson’s new schools programme, revealed exclusively in the Guardian today? The answer lies not in Downing Street, but 170 miles up the M1, with a revolt in a Cheshire market town. You don’t expect mutiny in Nantwich, but it was here a Tory shires revolt took place. In February 2017 the main square of the town was packed with locals protesting about the cash crisis in their schools. Their outrage made national news, and it chimed with other shaming stories that were spilling out of classrooms: of cash-strapped headteachers begging pupils to bring in their own loo roll; of teaching assistants getting laid off in droves and staff setting up food banks to feed their own pupils. When, just weeks later, Theresa May called her snap election, the protest leader Laura Smith stood for Labour in Crewe and Nantwich. The former primary teacher took on the junior education minister Edward Timpson – and won. On the night that sealed May’s fate, it was an emblematic battle that underlined the Tories’ complacency about the country they ruled. “Everybody thought [the campaign] would be about Brexit,” Smith said later. “But it was school funding.” I've never come across a policy document warning that government plans will lead to more kids being maimed or killed That 2017 insight of a Westminster newbie is conventional wisdom today in Downing Street. Boris Johnson is in trouble on schools, and he knows it. Unless he sorts it out he won’t claw back the likes of Crewe and Nantwich, and he won’t have a hope of winning a general election. That’s why, in the Tory leadership debates, he named education as a priority, second only to Brexit. And that’s why the government has lined up the bombardment of policies this paper reveals today. Put together, they make a dazzling display of political fireworks: a big cash injection; a drive for more academy schools; finger-wagging on student behaviour; and a final flourish on raising teacher numbers. Bang-bang-bang-bang. The headline writes itself: Boris’s Schools Revolution! And that might have been the story, too – until today’s publication of a briefing meant only for ministers and officials at the Department for Education. It is full of the stories that the government doesn’t want you to know, such as slashing the number of teaching assistants, as urged by No 10 and the Treasury, even though civil servants know this will go down like a bucket of cold sick with parents and teachers. The briefing advises: “We recommend we continue to push No 10 not to include this publicly.” Consider also the focus on headteachers being encouraged to “use reasonable force” on misbehaving students. Education officials caution that such a policy will “impact disproportionately on children in need of a social worker, children with special needs and … Black Caribbean Boys”. In other words, it will be state-led discrimination against minority groups. Ensuring that more kids are excluded will simply feed them into pupil referral units or lead to them getting schooled by gangs, so that police and crime commissioners, note the officials, “worry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime”. Of all the many policy-impact documents I’ve read, I have never come across one which warns that government plans will lead to more kids being maimed and killed, just for the sake of something that will look good across the front of the Daily Mail. But what about the money? How do the sums fit with the boasts being made by Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s top aide, that the government is ready for “the most beautiful spending round you’ve ever seen … billions and billions and billions of pounds”? The centrepiece is a one-off £2.8bn, which doesn’t reverse the cuts made over the course of this decade by the Conservatives. To do that, calculates the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, Johnson will need to stump up £3.8bn every year. And the majority of schools won’t see an extra penny, since the briefing makes clear that cash will be directed at “areas of the country that have been historically underfunded”, such as the south-west, Essex, Kent and the shires. The funny thing about those regions is that they just happen to be full of Conservative target seats. Think Canterbury, think Stroud … think Crewe and Nantwich. This isn’t sorting out our schools crisis – it is neutralising an electoral image problem. It is retrofitting policy to suit the polling objectives. Most of all, it is feigning concern while failing children. Over this decade of cuts, our classrooms have been turned into the new frontline of the welfare state, with staff filling in for councils in financial collapse and parents in precarious jobs or terrible housing. Any serious attempt to fix our schools would have to be combined with money to rebuild our welfare state. More dishonest yet is the startling pledge: “By September 2022, we want to see teacher starting salaries at £30,000, putting teaching at the top of graduate labour market.” An excellent bit of politics, which conveniently ignores the fact that teachers’ salaries are set not by ministers but an independent body, and that well before 2022 – indeed before this Christmas – Westminster expects a general election. But when the headline is so good, who minds if it’s contradicted by the story? Who at No 10 cares if they break the supposedly cast-iron impartiality of the civil service as long as it’s printing true-blue election leaflets? I cut my teeth as an economics journalist while Gordon Brown was first clunking around No 11, so I won’t pretend that all these tactics are brand new. But what shines through every pronouncement of this administration is its contempt for accuracy and, ultimately, for the public. This month started with Johnson dropping £1.8bn of “new money” on the NHS – that headline lasted until the afternoon of the announcement, when Downing Street was forced to admit that £1bn of that money was not new – and that the rest of it might not be either. Similarly, these school policies burst with many spending commitments that, the private memo admits in line after line, are merely “reprioritised programme spend” – Whitehall’s way of saying they’ll be paid for by cutting other parts of the teaching budget. Even so, millions will be poured into creating more academies and free schools, neither of which can be justified by any review of the evidence, but both of which Cummings is set on, intending to turn England into the most deregulated education sector in Europe. When Cummings was at the Department for Education, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Kevin Courtney, remembers his boss, Michael Gove pinning up on his office wall “a vertical map of England, with arrows showing how far academy trusts had penetrated parts of the country” – a Dad’s Army-style graphic of school privatisation. (A source tells me that academies minister Lord Agnew has given the map pride of place in his office.) None of this would fly in a serious country and with a press that retained a brain and a backbone. But we don’t have that. We have newspapers that yelp with glee at the sight of the prime minister swimming in the Bay of Biscay. And as revealed in this memo, we have a government that isn’t defined by care for the children who represent the future of this country. No, at its core is something pernicious: a cold, hard cynicism about what gets headlines, what tickles swing voters and what might win an election. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.32 BST When people think of the damage that wealthy countries – typically led by the US and its allies – cause to people in the rest of the world, they probably think of warfare. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died from the 2003 invasion, and then many more as the region became inflamed. But rich countries also have considerable power over the lives of billions of people through their control over institutions of global governance. One of these is the International Monetary Fund. It has 189 member countries, but the US and its rich-country allies have a solid majority of the votes. The head of the IMF is by custom a European, and the US has enough votes to veto many major decisions by itself – although the rich countries almost never vote against each other. To see what the problem looks like, consider a recent IMF loan. In March, Ecuador signed an agreement to borrow $4.2bn from the IMF over three years, provided that the government would adhere to a certain economic program spelled out in the arrangement. In the words of Christine Laharde – then the IMF chief – this was “a comprehensive reform program aimed at modernizing the economy and paving the way for strong, sustained, and equitable growth”. But is it? The program calls for an enormous tightening of the country’s national budget – about 6% of GDP over the next three years. (For comparison, imagine tightening the US federal budget by $1.4 trillion, through some combination of cutting spending and raising taxes). In Ecuador, this will include firing tens of thousands of public sector employees, raising taxes that fall disproportionately on poor people, and making cuts to public investment. The overall impact of this large fiscal tightening will be to push the economy into recession. The IMF’s projections are for a relatively mild recession until next year, but it will likely be much deeper and longer – as often happens with IMF programs. Unemployment will rise – even the IMF program projections acknowledge that – and so will poverty. One reason that it will likely turn out much worse than the IMF projects is that the program relies on assumptions that are not believable. For example, the IMF projects that there will be a net foreign private sector inflow into the economy of $5.4bn (about 5% of GDP) for 2019–2022. But if we look at the last three years, there was an outflow of $16.5bn (17% of GDP). What would make foreign investors suddenly so much more excited about bringing their money to Ecuador? Certainly not the recession that even the IMF is projecting. There are other implausible assumptions and even some that result from accounting errors, and sadly they all go in the same direction. It seems that the program’s “expansionary austerity” – something that almost never happens – is unlikely to make Ecuador into a world-famous exception, where the economy grows as aggregate demand is slashed. The program also seeks to reshape the economy in ways that, to many Ecuadorians, would appear to be political. The central bank will be made more autonomous; public assets will be privatized; and labor law will be changed in ways that give employers more unbridled power over workers. Some of these changes – for example, the separation of the central bank from other government decision-making – will make economic recovery even more difficult. All this is taking place under a government – elected in 2017 on a platform of continuity – that seeks to reverse a prior decade of political reforms. These reforms were, by measures of economic and social indicators, successful. Poverty was reduced by 38% and extreme poverty by 47%; public investment – including hospitals, schools, roads, and electricity – more than doubled as a percent of the economy. But the prior government was a leftwing government that was more independent of the US (by, for example, closing down the US military base there). One can imagine what this looks like, as the Trump administration now gains enormous power in Ecuador not only through the $4.2bn IMF loan, but also $6bn from related Washington-based multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. (This totals about 10% of Ecuador’s annual GDP – equivalent to more than $2.1tn in the US.) Actually, we don’t have to imagine much, since the new president, Lenín Moreno, has aligned himself with Trump’s foreign and economic policy in the region. At the same time, his government is persecuting his presidential predecessor, Rafael Correa, with false charges filed last year that even Interpol won’t honor with an international warrant. Other opposition leaders have fled the country to avoid illegal pre-trial detention – in the case of former foreign minister Ricardo Patiño, for making a speech that the government did not like. Since Washington controls IMF decision-making for this hemisphere, the Trump administration and the fund are implicated in the political repression as well as the broader attempt to reconvert Ecuador into the kind of economy and politics that Trump and Pompeo would like to see, but most Ecuadorians clearly did not vote for. All this provides even more reasons why there needs to be serious reform at the IMF, starting with making it more of a multilateral institution, as it pretends to be. In the past 20 years, the US Congress – which has to approve funding increases for the IMF – has on rare occasions intervened to eliminate some abuses. In the early 2000s, for example, millions of poor children in Africa gained access to primary education and health care because the US Congress made it impossible for the IMF and World Bank to require their governments to charge user fees for these basic needs – as these institutions had been doing for years. In the coming weeks, the IMF will almost certainly choose a new, affluent white European to head the institution. Progressive members of Congress, who care about what US foreign policy does to the rest of the world, should weigh in with some demands for reform.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.34 BST Good news from the bubble of party politics: Britain’s opposition leaders have today decided to engage and cooperate rather than facilitate national food and medicine shortages in nine weeks’ time. Many commentators suggested that Jeremy Corbyn’s meeting with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Change UK and Greens would yield little but grandstanding and bad temper. On the contrary, participants have described a positive and constructive session, with further summits planned. Their joint statement stresses the “urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence”. The statement represents a long-overdue acknowledgment that an unprecedented crisis must be met with an unprecedented response. Labour is correct that Boris Johnson threatens an abuse of power unparalleled by any British prime minister in modern times. If he is prepared to shred convention, so must his opponents. Today’s meeting is highly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that, when push comes to shove, politicians who may personally dislike or distrust each other can sit around a table and work seriously, cordially and productively. Second, and more importantly, it highlights that MPs have the means at their disposal to stop no deal. They already had the numbers. Now they are showing the willing. A no-deal Brexit has always been avoidable if MPs wanted to avoid it. That is because we live in a parliamentary democracy and not Johnson’s personal fiefdom. A legislative approach was always going to be less contentious than a vote of no confidence, because it does not require Tories to vote their own government out of office. With a new law, MPs can force the prime minister to request a new extension. They can demand that he accepts it. They can – and should – legislate for a revocation of article 50 if he fails to accept it or if the EU fails to grant it. Two-thirds of the Commons – like the public they represent – oppose no deal. They will also want to avoid being blamed for no deal. If they unite to stop it, they can – and there is now every reason to believe they will. Corbyn deserves credit here. He is not a politician famed for cross-party cooperation, but has acknowledged that his proposal to lead a caretaker government will probably fail, and has now invited 116 Tory opponents of no deal to join the dialogue. Perhaps our politicians really have grasped the truth of the moment: Johnson has left no more space for anyone else’s ego. Now is the time for flexibility and collegiality. Today has also taught us an important lesson about our political system. For the past fortnight, the opposition parties resorted to the zone of greatest comfort: partisan attacks. Labour and the Lib Dems were angrily denouncing each other. Corbyn was refusing to signal any openness to an alternative caretaker prime minister. Other parties were either demanding categorical assurances that Labour would now support remain in all circumstances, or else insisting they could not support Corbyn in any. This was tribalism at its most short-sighted and self-defeating. The only beneficiary was the government. No deal would be a calamity for our economy, society and democracy. Stopping it must be our absolute priority. But we can go further. Today must mark a comprehensive watershed in how our political parties interact in the national interest. It is possible to maintain a distinctive party identity while recognising, and even celebrating, common ground with others. On the continent this kind of cross-party cooperation is seen as normal and essential. It should not be considered revelatory here. In the end, perhaps Brexit will make us fully European after all. • Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.52 BST No one surely believes that when a newspaper tells its readers ahead of an election how to vote they simply do as they are told. There is no evidence whatsoever to show a direct correlation between what is published and what happens at the ballot box. Instead, media academics who have tried to divine the political impact of the press during elections, particularly the populist tabloid variety, have found it necessary to untangle a complex web of influences in order to explain why people voted as they did. Now, as if proving a positive wasn’t difficult enough, two academics have sought to prove a negative. Rather than arguing that readers of the Sun voted leave on the basis of their paper’s passionate pro-Brexit campaign, they want us to believe that not reading the paper contributed to a pro-European Union vote. Florian Foos and Daniel Bischof have produced research that claims that Euroscepticism in Liverpool gradually subsided during the course of the city’s 30-year boycott of the Sun. Therefore, they claim, it was the absence of the Sun that resulted in a pronounced switch by Liverpudlians in favour of remaining in the EU. Foos, an assistant professor in political behaviour at the London School of Economics, and Bischof, a senior political science researcher at Zurich University, do have the good grace to call their approach “quasi-experimental”. So, clearly, they know they are going out on a limb. Before I saw off their branch, here’s the gist of the argument. After the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, in which 96 Liverpool football fans died in a crush, the Sun wrongly accused the fans of being responsible for the deaths. It prompted many people on Merseyside to stop buying what was, and is, Britain’s best-selling daily. Spontaneous outrage turned into a long-term boycott. With several newsagents refusing to stock the Sun, it is estimated that sales fell by more than 40,000 a day and never recovered. Some Sun boycotters stopped reading a paper altogether. Most of the others, according to the research, switched to the Daily Mirror – the only one of the popular papers to support Britain’s EU membership. In other words, they were relieved from the relentless anti-EU agenda of the Sun from the 1990s onwards and subsequently, following the opening proceedings for the referendum in 2015, its pro-Brexit propaganda. According to Foos and Bischof, prior to Hillsborough the people of Liverpool, and the wider region of Merseyside, were generally Eurosceptic. Indeed, they were more anti-EU than 21 English counties with similar working-class demographics. Yet in their analysis of the 2016 referendum voting pattern, they found that residents in the city of Liverpool “voted significantly more remain than the rest of England” (58.2% in fact) while those across Merseyside as a whole showed “a slight edge for remain”. The Merseyside vote was 51% to 49% in favour of staying in the EU. In their view, this outcome suggested it was the boycott of the Eurosceptic Sun that “led to a decrease of Euroscepticism in Merseyside, which we estimate to amount to around 11 percentage-points”. That’s a bit of a leap of faith. They cannot be certain that the non-Sun factor was the major determinant of the pro-EU vote in Liverpool. Note, for instance, that neighbouring Manchester, where no Sun boycott took place, voted 60.4% remain. Moreover, their notion that switching to the pro-EU Mirror could have made a difference is entirely nonsensical. As the senior editorial staff of the Mirror privately conceded, once the referendum was called they played down their once wholehearted support for the EU precisely because their readership was so skewed towards Brexit. A large slice of the Mirror’s audience voted leave. But I do think the study indicates the possibility that a non-Sun diet might have had some influence on the vote. Although the academics only touched on it, I imagine that such was the depth of the city’s antipathy to the Sun and all it stood for that Liverpudlians were motivated to vote against anything it advocated. Foos and Bischof also argue that their study “shows that sustained media campaigns on emerging issues can have large, lasting, and ultimately, consequential effects on public opinion, and public policy”. While I’m uncertain about whether they have proved that with this particular study, I’m with them on the general point. Newspaper campaigns succeed by repetition over a prolonged period. Influence on public opinion takes place over years rather than as the result of a single political intervention. Turning that on its head, as the authors do, it could therefore be argued that the failure to be subjected to such a campaign also has an effect. Maybe, maybe not. This study doesn’t prove their argument but it’s an interesting case that suggests we should examine the lasting impact of the worldview of newspapers. • Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University and a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.45 BST Tim Bell was famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite PR guru. It’s not hard to see why. He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free-market views. He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs, top politicians and journalists. His death marks the end of a “golden” public relations era that spanned almost half a century, and Bell was one of its leading lights – and his particular star always shone brightly – for good and bad. I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid-1990s. It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown’s office. I was in my late 20s, had a young family and little money, and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy. Bell of course knew New Labour was coming. He hated having to prepare for it, but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless. The man, like most of us, was shot through with contradictions. On the surface it was all free-market, small-state nostrums, but the daily practice of running his company was a million miles from that. He treated everyone with care and compassion, to the ridiculous level of never sacking anyone, no matter how idle or useless they were. I refused the offer of private health insurance, only to be told by him that he’d just pay if me or my family were ever ill. He went to everyone’s leaving event and his door really was always open. I worked directly above his office and could never get past it without being called in to discuss the political events of the day, interspersed with endless cigarettes (his not mine) and calls from cabinet members and Fleet Street editors. His free-market morals found expression in his client base. He’d work for almost any dodgy dictator (though I wouldn’t). But he’d also take on clients who had views alien to his own. Through Bell I worked to help get Sweden into the EU – an institution he despised – and I cut my political teeth working with Alan Johnson, then head of the postal workers’ union, to stop Michael Heseltine privatising the Post Office. We won. Bell believed everyone had the right to representation – if, of course, you could afford his fees. To him, it was just business. He couldn’t believe I wouldn’t work for the fox-hunting lobby – didn’t they deserve representation too? This was, to say the least, a grey period in my life. It was the moment when New Labour became ascendant and, it seemed, the contradictions between labour and capital could be ignored – “the end of history”, the political economist Francis Fukuyama called the time, and so it felt. According to New Labour’s answer to Bell, Peter Mandelson (who learned much from Bell’s mastery of the media), there was nothing wrong with being “filthy rich”. Through Bell I learned how to make things happen. In the future I made sure I reserved these skills for things I really believed in. There is a bigger arc here, though, than just Bell’s life, as big as that was. He always argued that PR was “simply a truth well told”. But whose “truth”, and what happens when “well told” just becomes spin? I don’t think Bell cared – what mattered was influence and financial success. The practice of PR for him was to talk “your” side up and “their” side down. A zero-sum game. But as the pager gave way to the mobile and the fax to social media, truth stopped being what rich and powerful people said it was – not least through their well-paid advisers. That old world of command and control PR was being consigned to the same dustbin of history as command and control communism. In an increasingly networked society, truth is something we should be able to construct together transparently. New battle lines are now drawn: between those who would use nefarious means to manipulate and distort our information world and those with the democratic desire to exploit technical possibilities for the common good. A future that isn’t imposed on us but is negotiated by all of us. Bell was certain the free market and not the state was the answer to everything. And yet his empire was run like the nanny state, coddling everyone within it. He would quote Thatcher, in turn quoting John Wesley: “earn all you can, give all you can, save all you can”. Such entrepreneurialism mixed with altruism is not my guiding philosophy – but can we easily condemn those who espouse it? The world is complex. Tim Bell was a complex man. And today there are no simple truths to be told – just complex relationships and interests to be managed and negotiated. • Neal Lawson is director of the centre-left pressure group Compass"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.05 BST We’ll easily cope,” breezes the no-deal prime minister. “This is a great, great country.” Indeed it is. Most inhabitants would certainly agree. But to love your country is not to think it greater than others, nor incapable of making grievous mistakes. Britain has not, as yet, made the fateful error of actually electing Boris Johnson and his cabinet of undesirables. Nor did it vote for a no-deal Brexit. But on he drives, accelerating towards the abyss. It’s that insouciant ignorance that drives businesses mad; the devil-may-care fecklessness, ignoring the boring details. Andrea Leadsom, our improbable business secretary, writes in the Sunday Telegraph that she has met firms of all kinds and guess what? “They were overwhelmingly positive about our future.” She ends: “Britain’s best years for business and for all our people lie ahead.” All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can’t get the ear of any ministers Andrew Varga was driving along when he heard David Davis laughing on the Today programme as he expounded similar airy nonsense about the “trusted trader scheme” – goods checked in warehouses away from the border, all easy-peasy. “I was climbing the wall! Drives me to despair!” says Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol manufacturer of industrial safety valves. Perhaps Leadsom has only met happy businesses by refusing to hear from those like Varga, a Cambridge engineering PhD, who has failed to find a hearing with any branch of government for the inconvenient facts from companies like his. “My local Tory MP, Michelle Donelan, wouldn’t come to the factory: when I saw her in her surgery she couldn’t get rid of me fast enough.” Labour MPs have listened and visited but no Tory to date. At a large meeting with Suella Braverman, then Brexit minister, she parroted the usual empty phrases: “trusted trader” and “WTO rules”. Since 2016 he has been trying to raise the alarm, but “no one wants to know”. He wrote to the prime minister, who passed it on to Steve Baker, then at the Department for Exiting the European Union, but got a useless stock reply. At one time his exports were growing fast, with 130 employees and eight apprentices training to high standards, but since the referendum things have quickly changed. “Some EU customers instantly decided it was too much trouble and switched to EU manufacturers – we lost 10% of the business.” Others with his valves embedded will cut them out next time they redesign their machines. To trade in the EU he needs to obey rules of origin, recording every raw material, tracking every component, requiring “horrendous” new IT systems, his various valves containing 30,000 different configurations and “tripling our admin workload”. New security rules require fencing and guards round his perimeter with checks on staff, costing millions. Delays due to checks “are anathema to our just-in-time customers. They give us three chances: late once is a warning, twice is a final warning and then you’re out.” At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment. The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries. WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border. Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship. The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that ""in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none"". Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy. Martin Belam This is not just about the bottom line. There are emotional shocks too. “Our EU customers were our friends, but there was a sudden chill after 2016. I hear antagonism, nationalism rising, as if we are ‘other’ and not one of them any more. My people are upset by conversations with old customers who say: ‘You bloody Brits! You’re ruining everything, and we’re not going to pay the extra duty.’” His office staff are remainers, but the factory floor is split in half. “Everyone tiptoes around each other or it gets too heated. The Brexiters are aggressive, the remainers creep into their shell.” His father praised 1972’s entry into the common market. “Fantastic. Overnight just one gold standard for every product exported to every European country instead of a plethora of kite marks.” When Brexiters castigate EU regulations, “they have no idea how good they are for us”. Varga is a “congenitally liberal Tory, but I can no longer support that party”. Talk to others in quite different trades and the crescendo of despair rises as “do or die” day nears. Chris Slowey, head of Manfreight, a hauliers in Northern Ireland with 300 employees and 120 indirect jobs, lists just some of the crises ahead: they take Kerry Foods from the Republic to places like Leeds, but with a no deal “taking just one quiche across the border needs three vet certificates, for the milk, the ham and the eggs. That’ll take five times more vets and they’re short already.” He needs customs agents, who are in short supply. He buys 40 HGVs a year from Europe. “Each will cost £16,000 extra in tariffs, plus 16% on parts.” Here’s what just-in-time means for food deliveries – exactly 47 minutes from factory to ferry, two hours and 10 minutes crossing and eight hours max to stores in Leeds. “Any delay and drivers have to stop and take a break, but food has a short shelf-life.” He fears British stores will stop sourcing from Ireland – and until the Operation Yellowhammer leaks, neither he nor his Freight Transport Association had any warning of possible fuel shortages. “Just let them see what happens when customers can’t get what they want, people used to strawberries on Christmas Day.” And here’s Val Hennessy, director of International House, a large English language school in Bristol where Brexit is already “a disaster”. Five jobs have been lost so far. “Europe is our main market, lovely students bringing lovely money to Britain, a great export. But they sense they’re not welcome, they think we’re a bit xenophobic, a bit fascist – and they might need a visa. So they go to Ireland, whose schools are booming.” All three of these very different businesses make the same complaint. No one listens. They can’t get the ear of any ministers. No one wants to know what Brexit is doing already, or the devastation no deal will cause to companies like theirs. They warn that bogus reassurances about the UK’s preparedness will come unstuck. Lorry delays at ports may be sorted within weeks, but Varga says his problems are mostly “frog-boilers” – the steady loss of customers that has started already. Why hasn’t business shouted louder from day one? He tried, but others took fright in the face of hostile press coverage. He says businesses were warned that pro-leave customers would turn their back on products from companies that spoke out against Brexit. What these businesspeople share is sheer incredulity at what is happening, at politicians charging ahead deliberately remaining ignorant of the damage done. Expect the mighty £138m public information campaign to be empty propaganda. HMRC promises to contact “every known trader”, but why bother when they refuse to hear what they’d rather not know? Gordon Brown rightly calls for parliament to hold an independent inquiry into the consequences of a no-deal withdrawal, as Keir Starmer and the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake demand that MPs be given all the facts. The prime minister threatens not to honour our EU debts, which would guarantee that no free trade deal could ever be signed. But, he says, none of this is for parliament to decide. As we head towards the cliff-edge, it seems only this most cavalier and feckless of prime ministers is allowed to “take back control”. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.45 BST Arise, Lord Tim of Wetherspoon’s. Try on this ermine for size, any economist prepared to go against almost the entirety of your profession in arguing that a no-deal Brexit would be just terrific for Britain. The prime minister is reportedly drawing up a list of so-called “Brexit heroes” to be rewarded with peerages, although the word “hero” here is arguably being stretched to breaking point: the plan is apparently to ennoble a bunch of leading leavers after 31 October, in a clear rebuke to a House of Lords that has so far proved decidedly sceptical about the idea of leaving the EU at any price. Well done, everyone involved in dragging Britain into this godawful mess! Now here’s your reward: the chance to get a whole new set of life-changing political judgments wrong, for generations to come. Prime ministers packing the House of Lords with their own supporters is not exactly new, obviously – and if you don’t complain when your own side does it, then it’s hypocritical to complain when the other side does. After all, Theresa May’s own resignation honours list is expected to include the likes of her former chief of staff Gavin Barwell, who fought tirelessly behind the scenes for a more moderate Brexit and would be free to continue in the Lords with the gloves off. It’s only natural that Boris Johnson would retaliate in kind, stuffing a few no-deal enthusiasts on to those increasingly crowded red leather benches ahead of the battles to come (for even if we do leave the EU as promised on 31 October, that will only be only the start of years of haggling over the future relationship). If the names now doing the rounds seem hopelessly underqualified to make law, then the same is true of countless honours lists past padded out with party donors or nondescript MPs being bumped up to the Lords so some favoured political protege could have their Commons seats. But step back, and the overall picture emerging across public life is alarming. Johnson is rapidly correcting what many leavers see as the great strategic error of the last three years, which was to win the referendum battle but not the ensuing war. They got their popular mandate to leave, but never secured control of the political establishment charged with carrying it out. Parliament may be cowed and confused, afraid of confronting the 52%, but deep down it’s never been convinced by hard Brexiters’ arguments (and Tory peers, who unlike Tory MPs, have nothing to fear from an increasingly radicalised grass roots membership, have proved particularly hard to keep in line). Downing Street under May was full of former remainers, and while civil servants have done their level best to serve their masters with the requisite political neutrality, it’s not really neutrality the Johnson administration seeks now but the kind of gung-ho evangelical belief that finds a way through, regardless of the practical obstacles. Ordinarily, the fact that a no-deal Brexit unites this many smart and politically experienced Westminster people in a horror that transcends party lines would be seen as a giant, flashing red light. If the consensus is that an idea is barking mad, then the chances are it is. But the twisted logic of populism turns all that upside down, arguing that if “the establishment” is against something then it must be the establishment that needs changing, not the strategy. Hence the virtual takeover of No 10 by former Vote Leave staffers, led by Dominic Cummings, and emerging concerns within Whitehall that a more widespread politicisation of the civil service may now be on the cards. Some senior Tories have been arguing for years for a more activist, ideologically minded Whitehall machine that could help ministers drive through ideas that have popular support. Well, they’ll never have a better chance to secure it. What makes all this so ominous is that these would be permanent changes. Regimes in Downing Street come and go, but peers are peers for life, retaining the ability to shape the country’s future long after Brexit is either done and dusted (or, less likely, shelved for good). Civil service impartiality is rather like virginity in that once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. And the way Conservative membership associations handle deselection threats against rebellious remainer MPs will reverberate through parliament for years to come; it’s not just about who survives the cull, but about who would choose to try to become an MP in the current climate and who would walk away. Whatever the outcome of the daily fight over Brexit, it may have permanently changed the conditions under which future battles will be fought – and not for the better. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.05 BST It almost felt like magic. A few people standing on the street were joined by a few more; people lining the footpath of one block connected to those on the next block. And suddenly, there they all were. Hand in hand, chanting slogans and singing songs. On 23 August, the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way – a human chain linking the capitals of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to demand the Baltic republics’ independence from the Soviet Union – more than 200,000 people came out on to the streets of Hong Kong to form the “Hong Kong Way”. From the crowded streets of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island, to the famous waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui, to the suburbs of the New Territories, to the peak of Lion Rock, people linked hands in a continuous human chain that some said measured 60km in total. This was just the latest action in Hong Kong’s ongoing anti-government protest movement calling for democratic reforms. As a protest action, it was incredibly effective: entirely peaceful, a striking visual spectacle, and a very physical manifestation of the broad support for the movement from across the community. People of all ages and from all walks of life, families with young children, the elderly – all joined the chain and put paid to any suggestion that these ongoing protests were just a few hot-headed young student agitators. But perhaps most importantly, the Hong Kong Way created a moment of enchantment. It was a sharp contrast to the scenes of the weekend that followed: violent clashes between protesters and police on two consecutive days, which culminated in police deploying water cannon for the first time on Hong Kong’s streets and one officer firing a warning shot from his service revolver to fend off an angry mob police said threatened their lives. As the city continues to reel from months of protests, moments of enchantment such as Friday night’s Hong Kong Way offer a reprieve from the escalating cycle of violence and rays of hope for the protest movement. The feeling of “enchantment”, according to political theorist Jane Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, is something that stops you in your tracks, leaving you transfixed and spellbound – a suspension of time and movement. Places or moments of enchantment can inspire a sense of wonder or awe, even fill us with overwhelming feelings of generosity and love for the world. But enchantment can also serve a political purpose. Today’s Hong Kong feels overwhelmed by the forces of disenchantment. The ongoing protests have drawn upon a deep-seated malaise, with a population that feels they are stuck with a leader they didn’t choose, running a government that doesn’t listen to them, in a city whose housing they cannot afford and with wages and an economy that are going nowhere. Many of those who can leave are actively planning to do so. Others appear to be caught in a despair that has driven them out on to the streets in the increasingly desperate protests. As Bennett argues, it is hard to love a disenchanted city. Sites or moments of enchantment, such as the Hong Kong Way, offer a solution to Hong Kong’s political and social ennui, helping to lift the fog of cynicism and disenchantment, and encouraging hope and engagement in civic life. The government seems to fail to understand that this battle will not be won in dollars and cents or through crude force Hong Kong’s activists have long had an ability to capture this sense of enchantment: sites such as the colourful Lennon walls, which have blossomed across the pedestrian underpasses and footbridges of the city in recent months, or the vibrant tent city of 2014’s Umbrella Movement; moments such as the annual 4 June candlelit vigils held to commemorate Tiananmen Square, through to the solemn lawyers’ silent marches, a deeply moving expression of a legal profession in mourning for the city’s rule of law. In response, Beijing and the Hong Kong government have tried to exhort the population to “Love Hong Kong” by deploying crude propaganda and economic bribes, such as financial secretary Paul Chan’s “mini-budget” of recent weeks which purported to relieve the economic stress of the protests by offering residents the equivalent of a few hundred pounds’ worth of subsidies. The government seems to fail to understand that this is not a battle that will be won in dollars and cents or through crude force. It needs to enchant the people if it wants to compete. Activists around the world may also wish to take note: in the battle against governments for hearts and minds, enchantment may be their most powerful weapon. • Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer"

That he is a serious threat to the president shows how low the bar has been set Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.20 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.30 BST Donald Trump has been very good for a lot of very bad people’s careers. Take Sean Spicer, for example. Spicer lied through his teeth during his stint as White House press secretary and has been rewarded with a gig at Harvard and a spot on Dancing With the Stars – where, presumably, he will continue to prance around the truth. His successor, Sarah Sanders, is joining Fox News. Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted only 10 days as Trump’s communications director, has reinvented himself as a high-profile critic of his former boss. The latest odious person to scramble aboard the Trump gravy train is Joe Walsh, a rightwing talk-radio host and former congressman. On Sunday, Walsh announced he would challenge Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination because “we all know [he] is unfit” to lead – which is a dramatic change of tack from 2016, when Walsh tweeted: “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” Walsh is Trump’s second primary challenger; Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, threw his hat in the ring earlier this year. You would be forgiven for not knowing this, as Weld’s candidacy generated little interest and he is way behind Trump in the polls. Weld poses no threat to Trump. Walsh, on the other hand, may just. Let’s be clear: Walsh is not someone to root for. He is basically a carbon copy of the president, just less orange. Like Trump, Walsh has a long history of racism, tweeting things such as: “We LOWERED the bar for Obama. He was held to a lower standard cuz he was black.” Like Trump, he is a self-aggrandising narcissist. And, like Trump, Walsh has a hard time practising the “family values” the Republican party likes to preach: in 2011, for example, Walsh’s ex-wife sued him for more than $117,000 (£71,500) in child support. (The pair later issued a statement saying they “now agree that Joe is not and was not a ‘deadbeat dad’”.) Now that he is running for the Republican nomination, Walsh has apologised for his past bigotry and his role in helping to “create Trump”. I suppose there is a tiny chance that Walsh is genuinely a changed man. What is more likely is that he reckons there is a payday in all this. Motives aside, though, he may be the biggest threat yet to Trump’s chances in 2020. After all, in the past 50 years, every sitting president who has faced a serious challenge from his own party went on to lose in the general election. While Trump’s team purport not to see Walsh as a serious challenger (their reaction to his announcement was “whatever”), Walsh is seriously good at squirming his way into the limelight. He may not turn Trump’s cult-like base away from him, but he may get more conservatives to speak out against the president – he is already urging Republicans to “say publicly what you believe privately”. At the very least, there is a good chance that Walsh’s attention-seeking antics will distract and frazzle Trump. Of course, even if Walsh ends up hurting Trump’s re-election prospects, his candidacy is not something to celebrate. Whatever happens, we should mourn the fact that Trump has set the presidential bar so low that a radio host who has been openly racist and can’t pay child support on time thinks he is qualified for the most powerful job in the world. •Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 16.11 BST You can tell there’s a general election coming, because that’s the subtext to everything else that happens. Boris Johnson uses the G7 summit to grandstand to the domestic tabloids. Meanwhile the fractious coalition of anti-no-deal forces meets today to try and form a coherent plan to stop Britain crashing out of the EU – and to force an election. If the object was to fight no deal through parliamentary process, the only people you would need in the room would be Dominic Grieve and Keir Starmer, with maybe somebody taking notes for John Bercow. But today’s get-together, convened last week by Jeremy Corbyn, is as much about a general election, which few people now doubt will happen sooner rather than later. Given that, it would have been better to enter the room in the spirit of anticipated unity, rather than publicly set out your red lines beforehand, as Jo Swinson has done. She reportedly wrote a letter to Corbyn yesterday, arguing that his insistence on leading a temporary government of national unity would be likely to scupper a vote of no confidence in the government. One of the many things I look forward to, at the end of this whole ignominious business, is the prospect of politicians finally ceasing to flaunt their inflexibility as if it were a virtue. Because it isn’t. Yet if Corbyn, Swinson and co can recognise a few elemental truths about their predicament, the meeting today could yet deliver something invaluable to those of us outside it: hope. All remain parties and actors need to stop performing their oppositional moves and accept as an inevitability that they have to work together. Labour historically, and Jeremy Corbyn personally, have shown no aptitude or enthusiasm for progressive alliances, but the leader of the opposition must recognise that activists and members are going to work together regardless, as they did in 2017 (and as they did in 1997). There is a very plain advantage to be had for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats from reaching an understanding (the Greens stand to gain the least, I would guess; Caroline Lucas, fortunately, doesn’t fight for her own or her party’s collective ego). According to yet-to-be-published projections made by Best for Britain, of the 150 marginals across England and Wales where a remain alliance could make the difference, in 111 the numbers dictate that the Lib Dems swing behind Labour. The benefit to Labour is obvious. For Swinson, 40-odd seats would still represent a massive uptick in her party’s fortunes. Remainers on the centre-right, who are currently cleaving to what’s been called the Meatloaf stance (“I’d do anything for Europe, but I won’t make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister”) have to think more deeply about their objections. Whatever threat Corbyn may pose to capitalism, it is as nothing compared to the threat from vulture capitalists and high priests of disruption and chaos emptying their pots of cash into Dominic Cummings’ cauldron. If the danger represented by this government bore any relation to its competence, we’d have nothing to worry about. But the disunity of the forces opposing it is giving it a potency it does not deserve. We will only haul ourselves out of this nightmare period when the politics of solidarity and co-operation wrests the controls from the politics of delinquency and destruction. That has to start in this meeting. There’s a good argument for them all to smoke a joint before they go in. It is also increasingly clear that Labour has an additional challenge of its own: the party needs to pivot to “revoke”. Not as a peace offering to the other parties, but because it’s the only position that now makes sense. The idea of a Labour-negotiated deal, which protects workers’ rights, drives forward international cooperation on the environment, and maintains the EU as our major trading bloc, while differing meaningfully from membership of the EU, is fanciful. A second referendum, meanwhile, is pointless given that any general election will, itself, function as one: the Brexit parties are there for Brexiteers to vote for. Of course, if a government of national unity itself chose to revoke article 50, then arguably that would create a democratic deficit. But if, in the context of an election, the country is asked point blank whether it wants to leave or revoke, no such crime against the will of the people has been perpetrated. The Conservatives and the Brexit party are making the vast unsubstantiated promise that a combination of grit, optimism and tech will solve every problem associated with Brexit. Some of us spend our time wondering why these arguments hold fast against any evidence to their contrary; why they’re so immune to reality and reason. But Labour now needs to make a vast promise of its own: revoke. In that moment, Brexit will be revealed for what it is – a civil war embroiling all of us that should have stayed within the confines of the Conservative party, where it belonged. Boris Johnson and Cummings will not be waiting with bated breath to see if a vote of no confidence prevails. They will have their decision tree, with a general election on one branch, a no-deal Brexit on the other; it all leads ultimately to the polling booth, and all who oppose them should be ready for an election on the first possible date: 17 October, six weeks after parliament reassembles. And readiness is not a reheating of Facebook ads and leaflets with slightly-too-complicated promises; it is a united promise to revoke, from allies who put their nation ahead of their tired hostilities. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/death-destruction-david-koch-legacy,"Anarcho-capitalism was the real cancer plaguing the billionaire libertarian. And it spread across universities, halls of Congress and the White House Contact author Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.50 BST In 1992, billionaire industrialist David Koch was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given just a few years to live. Thanks to his enormous wealth, he was able to purchase the best treatment in the world, and he survived 27 more years until his death last week. For all his adult life, he’d led Koch Industries, a diversified manufacturing conglomerate, with his older brother Charles. Now taking in around $110bn per year, the company creates chemicals and fertilizers; it produces synthetic materials such as Lycra; it sells lumber and churns out paper and glass products; it makes electronics components used in weapons systems. But first and foremost, Koch Industries mines and refines petroleum and operates pipelines to spread it throughout North America. Koch Industries, a private company, is the United States’ 17th-largest producer of greenhouse gases and the 13th-biggest water polluter, according to research from the University of Massachusetts Amherst – ahead of oil giants Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum and Phillips 66. The conglomerate has committed hundreds of environmental, workplace safety, labor and other violations. It allegedly stole oil from Indian reservations, won business in foreign countries with bribery, and one of its crumbling butane pipelines killed two teenagers, resulting in a nearly $300m wrongful death settlement. The dangerous methane leakage, carbon emissions, chemical spills and other environmental injustices enacted by Koch’s companies have imperiled the planet and allegedly brought cancer to many people. But it took Koch’s own struggle with the disease for him to care about cancer and fund research to combat it. This is the tragic mindset of many a rightwing oligarch: The toils, the woes, the maladies of humankind are irrelevant – unless they happen to me, or perhaps my close family members. I’ve never struggled to live on $7.25 per hour, so why is it a problem? An ailment has never caused me to go bankrupt, so why would anyone possibly need government subsidies to pay for life-saving medical care? Climate change has never directly affected my life so I’ll keep on denying that humans have anything to do with it. Even though I inherited a business and a fortune, I earned every cent of my astronomical net worth. If you worked as hard as I have, you would have what I have, too. Koch epitomized this grotesquely selfish mentality during his 1980 vice presidential campaign on the Libertarian ticket, when he ran on abolishing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, welfare benefits, the minimum wage and the Environmental Protection Agency. He put $2m of his own money into the effort and campaigned to ax all campaign finance laws so he and his brother could maximize their bloated political influence without any pesky rules attempting to honor the constitutional premise of American elections: “One person, one vote.” It is this cruel mindset that was the real cancer plaguing David Koch. It wouldn’t kill him, but it would spread itself into university curricula, the halls of Congress, regulatory agencies, and the White House. It possessed the unfathomably rich who came before him, and it will infect the opulent oligarchs who come after him. It is the cult of anarcho-capitalism, the faithful worship of the divine free market that has shined so brightly on Koch and his family. If only we could do away with government altogether, we’d become a true utopian society: a handful of corporate monarchs ruling over billions of wretched serfs who toil away until their deaths, faithfully adding zeros to the quarterly revenues of the select few at their own fatal expense. Not only did Koch help unleash countless metric tons of greenhouse gases from the earth, he was a key funder of climate change denialism, stiff-arming scientists in order to further plunder the earth he was destroying. Revelations in Christopher Leonard’s new book, Kochland, show that Koch played an even greater role in funding climate change denialism than we previously knew. As we careen towards a climate catastrophe that seems more and more likely to happen within the next 11 years, we can rightly pin a portion of the blame on David and his brother. With Charles, David funded and participated in a network of free-market thinktanks that produced academic literature in support of slashing taxes and gutting regulations in order to aid mega-corporations like Koch Industries. These ideological centers include the Cato Institute, which the Kochs founded and where David was a longtime board member; the American Enterprise Institute, where he was a member of its National Council; George Mason University’s Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies; and the Heritage Foundation. Now alumni of the Koch academic and policy network have become government administrators, regulatory officials, political advisers and lifetime judges. In 1984, David co-founded the predecessor to the non-profit Americans for Prosperity (AFP), among the first of many political major groups the brothers would fund and operate. The Kochs increased their political spending and engagement over decades, using AFP and other groups to publicize the thinktanks’ laissez-faire policy proposals and pressure members of Congress to support them. In 2009, AFP helped get the allegedly grassroots Tea Party off the ground, as it and other Koch network organizations began years of campaigning against President Obama’s effort to give millions of low-income Americans health insurance and expanded Medicaid. David has funded research into cancer therapies but appears to believe that only the financially secure deserve treatment. Spending by the Kochs’ political groups and campaign donations from the Kochs and their company’s Pac made a wave of rightwing ideologues into lawmakers at the state and federal levels. The Tea Party sweep in 2010, a phenomenon that laid the groundwork for a rightwing nationalist president, would not have been nearly what it was without the Koch largesse. Now the Koch political network claims to be distressed at President Trump’s cruel immigration policies and tariff wars, yet the network championed the contemporary far-right movement that has seated countless lawmakers who revel in anti-immigrant and nationalist policymaking. In the current decade, while Koch-backed state legislators made sweetheart deals with oil and gas companies and crippled the progress of solar companies, Koch beneficiaries in the House and Senate were cutting taxes, undoing federal regulations, and doing all they could to kick millions of Americans off of their health care coverage. When you walk around Cambridge, Massachusetts, you’ll pass by MIT’s David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research or the David H Koch Childcare Center. When taking in upper-crust Manhattan arts and culture, you’ll come across Lincoln Center’s David H Koch Theater. For those who don’t know about Koch’s business and political operations, he must seem like a generous man. The directors of these institutions are ever grateful to Koch. “David Koch was a model philanthropist who funded initiatives across a swath of cultural, scientific, and medical institutions,” Robert Millard, chair of the MIT Corporation, said in MIT News. “His generosity has benefited humanity broadly – from the arts to cancer research to science. MIT is deeply thankful for his many contributions to our community.” “His contributions to medical research will live on forever; they have and will continue to benefit millions of Americans and others around the world,” said Jonathan Simons, CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, in a tribute to Koch. “We will miss his sense of humor, his wisdom and his insightfulness.” Koch may have kept some arts institutions on life support, bolstered the Natural History Museum’s dinosaur exhibition, or employed cancer researchers, but we must not let these philanthropic acts cover for a billionaire whose corporate greed has gravely endangered the future of the planet and the human species. This is the point of these seemingly magnanimous contributions: to cast the Kochs in a positive light, deflecting criticism of Koch Industries’ shameful business practices and defending the legacy of a heartless robber baron. What was the prime motivator behind the life and career of Koch, an MIT-educated chemical engineer who denied the existence, and the harms, of man-made climate change? Was it his extreme distaste for authority, birthed during his youth under a strict, Nazi-supporting nanny and an often absent father? Was it a religious commitment to free-market capitalism and an honest belief that the market, if truly unfettered, will solve every daunting problem for humanity? Was it a sincere belief that, although he and his brother were born to a wealthy oil executive, every single poor and working-class person could pull themselves up from nothing, with no help from anyone, in a drastically unequal society, if they just tried harder? I don’t think it was any of these explanations. The answer is very simple. It was greed, the blind pursuit of horrifying wealth and power. An addiction that has left the country less equal and the planet endangered. David Koch died as the eleventh-richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of $51bn. His name is plastered on the facades of New England cancer centers and Manhattan hospitals and performance halls. But these historical imprints are temporary and relatively inconsequential compared to his lasting legacy, something far more significant, and terrifying. Koch’s never-ending quest for obscene wealth no matter the consequence – and that of his brother, his fellow oligarchs and his political allies – will be part of every future climate change-intensified weather disaster; every city undone by catastrophic sea level rise; every animal species that goes extinct because of warmer waters, desertification, or biblical floods; and every desperate climate refugee. Death and destruction. That is David Koch’s legacy. Alex Kotch is a senior investigative reporter at Sludge, a news website focused on money in politics"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 20.18 BST The G7 summit in Biarritz, now thankfully concluded, told us a lot about the world we live in. Unfortunately, very little of it was useful or vaguely hopeful. As the presidents and premiers of the world’s wealthiest countries posed for back-slapping group photos, and their partners sampled croissants at a charming “traditional Basque bakery”, fierce fires raged untended and unquenched across the international landscape – not to mention in the Amazon rainforest. It was a low-yield meeting whose main achievement was avoiding a repeat of last year’s bust-up. It was as though these summiteers, conflabbing while the world burned, belonged to a different, distant era when the US president, for example, was a figure commanding instant respect; when multilateral diplomacy worked; when the postwar internationalist vision was not obscured by nationalist demagoguery; when, if the western democracies decided to do something together, it actually had a good chance of getting done. But those times have passed. The summit told us about leadership – or what passes for it these days. For Emmanuel Macron, the understandably frazzled maitre d’, concentrating the minds of so many inflated political egos was more challenging than taming the domestic challenge of les gilets jaunes (yellow vests). France’s president abandoned the usual practice of issuing a joint communiqué. After Donald Trump trashed the last one in Quebec, insulting his hosts, that was probably wise. Yet Trump is not the only black hole where a leader should be. It’s true Angela Merkel is counting down to retirement in 2021. But any hopes that she would pick up the baton where American leadership has failed since 2016, at least as a champion for Europe, have proved ill-founded. Her cautious, money-minded approach has too often focused instead on reining in Macron’s grander reformist ideas. A German chancellor might at one time have confidently looked to Britain to add weight and mettle to Europe’s views on, say, Vladimir Putin’s war on domestic political opponents and unchecked disregard for international law in Ukraine and Syria. But Boris Johnson, while agreeing Russia’s president should not be readmitted to the G7, exhibits scant interest in, let alone leadership on, such difficult issues. His “keep Trump happy” policy shows how low, and how quickly, Britain is sinking. Others gathered round the table at Biarritz are not much better. Where is the leader who will stand up and tell Trump, to his face, that his incendiary bid to bring Iran to its knees will not work – and cannot be supported? Who will tell Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces attacked no fewer than three regional neighbours – Iraq, Lebanon and Syria – at the weekend, to stop stoking regional fires in the hope of winning re-election next month? What has the G7 got to say about the reduction of the UN security council to a state of feeble impotence, where Russian and Chinese (and sometimes US) vetoes prevent effective action to mitigate humanitarian disasters such as the Saudi-led war in Yemen or the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar? What about the atrocities daily visited upon besieged Syrian civilians in Idlib? And where is the G7 clubbers’ masterplan for rescuing the global economy from a trade war-driven recession? No China, no comment – while Trump shifts shiftily almost by the hour. The shaming list of roads not travelled, of issues not tackled, of calamities ignored or dodged, is all but endless. To this must be added the accelerating US-China-Russia nuclear arms race and the environmental impact of great power rivalries in the Arctic. To his credit, and to the annoyance of Trump officials who deemed it a “niche issue”, Macron gained support for collective action on the Amazon. As with previous G7 pledges, follow-through is what matters now. Having outwardly responded to the public clamour, what will actually be done? The $20m aid package announced today to help Amazon countries fight wildfires appears, frankly, on the low side. The summit inadvertently told us, too, about multilateralism and the fabled rules-based international order – and how these always flawed systems of global governance, symbolised by the G7 since the 1970s, may be on their last legs. That’s due in large part to the refusal of emerging 21st-century powers, principally China but also lesser states, to abide by other people’s rules ill-suited to their purposes. It’s due to a broad upsurge, in Europe and elsewhere, of rightwing, populist nationalism that has shaken the centrist consensus and is typified by the rise and rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy – and by Brexit. It is due to a failure of confidence among post-2008 western democracies which are beset by austerity and widening wealth and trust gaps. Multilateralism’s atrophy is due, too, to multiple betrayals by Trump’s America. Yet if the Biarritz summit told us fairly conclusively that the G7 is no longer fit for purpose, what if anything can replace it? The paradox of our age is that the world has never been more connected, yet the political tools for acting collectively in pursuit of common purposes are increasingly ineffective. Scrap the G7 and expand the G20, making it a more genuinely inclusive forum? Reboot the UN, either by reforming the security council or making the general assembly its primary decision-making body? Or start again from scratch? A fundamental rethink may be unavoidable, given that the US will host next year’s G7. Trump is certain to manipulate the meeting for political and personal advantage, reducing other leaders to walk-on extras in his noxious re-election drama. It’s time to think again about who rules the world, and how – while there’s still a world left to rule. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.33 BST Ask a random British person over the age of 30 if they can locate the origins of the phrase “don’t mention the war” and I’d hazard that most would guess correctly. Most British people of a certain age have seen, or at least heard of, Basil Fawlty’s guesthouse goosestep in the famous Fawlty Towers episode The Germans. It is a fundamental part of our comedy culture. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Fawlty Towers has been suggested as a candidate for a new TV channel proposed by the thinktank British Future in order to help migrants familiarise themselves with English, and English culture. Only Fools and Horses, Midsomer Murders, and Simon Schama’s History of Britain have also been recommended. And yet, these apparent cultural touchstones seem to me somewhat narrow – both from the standpoints of age, and nationality (you may note my use of “English culture” in the preceding paragraph). Only Fools and Horses has never really spoken to me in the same way as has say, Kevin Allen’s dark comedic masterpiece Twin Town, set in Swansea (“buy your own fucking glue”), or the hen do scene in Gavin and Stacey, but then I grew up in Wales. The suggestions for the new channel seem to connote a particular vision of Englishness that is no longer as culturally relevant as a flick through the Mail or an afternoon with UKTV Gold might imply. And yes, it suggests a rather white, middle-England, middle-class outlook, and is, well, a bit too close to some Brexiters’ version of the country. That’s not to say that I don’t appreciate Fawlty Towers. That episode aired in 1975, 12 years before I was born in June 1987, in London. Six months earlier, my cousin David was born in Valenciennes. Raised in France, his immersion in English was thanks not only to his English mum but also to taped episodes of Fawlty Towers at my grandparents’ house. He was able to quote from it copiously, and also found the French impersonations in ’Allo ’Allo hilarious. His English is now excellent. I also count Fawlty Towers as a crucial part of the cultural influence gifted to me by my English grandparents, along with Shakespeare, “pre-pran” gin and tonics, and Just William. On the other side, there was more of a Welsh influence (male voice choirs, In Parenthesis by David Jones, the importance of unions, bara brith). I value both equally, which is why any television channel for new arrivals (or those who have been here a while and are still struggling with the language) needs to reflect an expanded notion of Britishness that reflects the overlapping identities that we all have in one way or another. It’s not just about language, though. I agree with British Future that speaking English is crucial to integration, and that lack of access to classes because of prohibitive costs, working hours and oversubscription needs to be improved. A television channel – surely it would have to be some sort of streaming offering – has the potential to provide shared cultural reference points that lead to mutual understanding, but if it is to work it is crucial that the variety of programming reflects modern Britain. My mother teaches English as a foreign language and uses comedy panel shows as resources for students. To those I’d maybe add Chewing Gum, Stormzy at Glastonbury, The Great British Bake Off, Peep Show, Billy Connolly’s stand-up, Planet Earth, The Thick of It, People Just Do Nothing, Jeremy Deller’s rave documentary, Adam Curtis’s HyperNormalisation, Fleabag, and Jo Brand (just all of her). But that’s just me. No doubt you’d have your own cultural touchstones – that’s the point. Though funnily enough, while thinking about what sorts of programming I’d choose for a TV channel geared towards English learners, it’s amazing how many of them had previously aired on the BBC. That beleaguered broadcasting corporation which can never seem to do anything right, being as it is constantly attacked, maligned, and accused of bias from all sides. Sometimes, in the case of John Humphrys – destroyer of mornings – that irritation is justified. But what a thing. When it comes to a vision of what we are and what we stand for, what else really cuts it? Just ask my cousin David. Though he might just bid you “Good Moaning”. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.48 BST The 2020 US presidential election is going to be about native entitlement. It’s going to be about race and immigration and deportation and Israel and every other wedge issue Donald Trump can summon to split the vote into “us” and “them”. He will become Chief Native, swelling his supporters’ sense of dominion over others less white. The campaign has already started; his social media presence has gone from ungainly swiping to a more coherent regular punching. He has in effect launched a cyber-bullying offensive. Trump will reduce people to tears, from black TV anchors worn down by his racist attacks to Rashida Tlaib, reeling from the unexpected emotional shock of her Palestinian grandmother being dragged in the mud of Trump’s bear pit. He will tell Jews how to vote and nurture antisemitism while pretending to give a damn about Israel so that he can smear Muslim opponents. What was a prominent theme in the 2016 campaign, going after Muslims and immigrants, will become the only theme. It might appear to be an unprecedented escalation, but Trump is only the latest Republican politician to leverage white identity politics for electoral gain, the only difference, as with everything else that sets him apart from his predecessors, is that he is not intelligent enough to do it subtly. There really are no more excuses. A Trump voter in 2020 is a voter who can no longer plausibly pretend, to themselves or others, that their reasons are down to economic anxiety or some “left behind” resentment. Yet these excuses will be rolled out anyway, so established are the patterns that let voters off the hook for supporting racial supremacy. In 1990, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, David Duke, ran for Senate in Louisiana and secured 43% of the vote. One could not distinguish between the justifications for voting for Duke then and the reasons white people voted for Trump in 2016: a working-class post-recession revolt; an angry message from the disenfranchised to the elites of Washington. Duke only lost because black people voted overwhelmingly against him. The same happened almost 30 years later when Roy Moore, Alabama’s Republican candidate for the US Senate, ran what the Washington Post called a “white populist” campaign. Moore romanticised the era of slavery, referred to Native Americans and Asian Americans as “reds and yellows”, questioned whether former president Barack Obama had been born in the US and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He was thwarted, because black people voted against him. Despite this history, the Democrats are still not ready. They are still unable to fully engage in the looming identity wars of 2020. Trump’s entire political strategy has become reduced to identity politics not only because he is incapable of anything more sophisticated, but also because it gets results. The leftwing establishment (for so long accused of playing the identity politics card) is taking the blows passively, having internalised the largely baseless accusations that it is out in the wilderness because its message was too focused on minorities. This might have been true at some point, when there were big electoral gains to be made after the 1960s when discreet marginalised groups became identifiable as voting blocks and the left wooed them. But lately the left’s overtures towards those groups have been mainly to make the right noises and take them for granted. The result was that in 2016, the black voter turnout rate dropped for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election. The 7% fall was the largest ever recorded for that demographic. There is no success in political battle more unequivocal than convincing your opponent that they are wrong. The right has managed to succeed not only in persuading voters that the left is obsessed and distracted by identity politics at their expense, but in planting this seed of self-doubt in the minds of leftwing politicians themselves. Steve Bannon summed this up. He couldn’t “get enough” of the left’s “race-identity politics” he said. “The longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em … I want them to talk about race and identity … every day.” Only Trump is allowed to talk about race and identity every day. The only acceptable way to wield racial politics these days is against its victims, rather than in their defence. The hesitation is everywhere, from the Democratic party leadership’s reluctance to weigh in forcefully enough in defence of “the Squad” – four congresswomen of colour targeted by Trump, or “four people” who “didn’t have any following”, according to House speaker Nancy Pelosi – to the liberal media’s pearl-clutching at calling Trump racist (“We are not fucking part of the resistance,” according to a New York Times staffer). The mainstream American left is hamstrung by a misplaced sense of decorum and fixated on an outdated view that tackling the Trump assault head-on is somehow “radical”, a strategy that will dent the Democrats’ ability to win due to a loss of “moderates”. All this despite the fact that the whole “when they go low we go high” approach didn’t work out so well in 2016. And it won’t work this time either. The left must dive into the identity politics pool, convert the jaded and make a pitch for the soul of those Trump’s vision has captured by showing how his incendiary politics makes the world less safe for everyone. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it works. And because there really isn’t much of a choice any more. A recent poll showed that independents in Wisconsin (a crucial swing state won by Trump three years ago) cite “immigration” as their top electoral issue. For those crucial defecting Democratic voters (about a third of Obama-voting counties flipped for Trump in 2016), there are already signs that the “change” candidate they saw in Trump has not delivered. This cohort will be even more susceptible to being won back by a Democratic party pitching in a positive, explicitly inclusive way, rather than fixating on Trump’s failures. Inspiring emotion is often more effective than delivering information. When the New York Times canvassed voters in Ohio, the big takeaway was: “Several voters said they chose Mr Trump for the same reason they chose Mr Obama: a deep craving for change.” The evidence this approach works is Trump himself, a man who has nothing to offer but a coherent vision of the future. In a recent interview Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez said: “Whether you like it or whether you hate it, a wall is a vision, it’s a tangible vision that is symbolic and representative and galvanising. And if we do not have an ambitious, inspiring, galvanising vision, I think we risk losing even more.” To prepare for 2020 the Democrats must hold their noses and wade into the immigration and race melee. They must do it with conviction, consistency and emotional resonance, rather than with a sort of competent, managerial presence that frowns upon engaging with Trump on his own terms as unruly. Being reactive and “fact-checking” Trump can only get us so far. The fight must be both dirty and inspiring. It needs to get to a point where a Democratic presidential candidate can say: “The longer Trump and the Republicans talk about identity politics, I got ’em.” • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.40 BST If one wanted evidence that Whitehall was being steadily politicised, one need look no further than today’s exclusive story on Boris Johnson’s plans for “a series of staged announcements” on English schools. The leaked memo from civil servants to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, shows a concern about spinning for power rather than speaking truth to it. The advice reads like a blueprint for an election campaign, one in which the government is solely concerned with renewing its contract with the electorate. That makes the document no less revealing about Mr Johnson’s policies. There are the promises of extra money for schools to counter the charge, effective in 2017, that the choice in education is between Labour investment and Conservative austerity and neglect. There is a love-bombing of public sector workers, in this case teachers, with a promise – easily made but hard to make good on – of raising their starting pay to £30,000 a year. This is an audacious raid on Labour territory with the cash benefiting “young, female and non-white” state employees who, after years of cuts, disdain the Tories. While the extra cash – £2bn – is to be welcomed and is what Mr Johnson promised on the stump, it only reverses cuts of 4% in schools’ per pupil funding since 2015. Double that sum is needed to reverse the effects of austerity inflicted since 2009. The cash, the memo makes clear, is contingent on “efficiency” gains in schools – driven, if history is any guide, by a misguided ideological dislike of local authority influence, and a blind faith in a form of failed, lightly regulated marketisation. When there is new money it is not enough: the £800m for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) won’t fill the £1.2bn hole left by cuts. Instead of coming up with a policy for further education, essential given the OECD’s warning that England is the only rich country where the literacy and numeracy levels of 16- to 24-year-olds are no greater than those of 55- to 65-year-olds, officials tout a cash sum that falls short of the amount asked for by colleges and suggest an aspiration of “besting Germany at technical education”. This is a declaration that is unlikely to send a shiver down the backbone of the world’s fourth-largest economy. As well as blasts on the foghorn, there are the toots on dog whistles too. The talk of using “reasonable force” to promote good behaviour is chilling. But officials say “many will welcome a harder narrative on discipline” in schools, noting drily that police and crime commissioners say the inevitable school exclusions will drive up knife crime and social workers will raise the disproportionate impact this will have on African-Caribbean children. To deal with the downsides, civil servants suggest with a straight face that ministers “consider stakeholder handling more fully”. The same PR advice is offered on how to deal with the “rising number of teaching assistants”, who are popular with “parents, teachers, heads and the SEND lobby” but not with the Treasury and No 10. Britain is an increasingly divided society, one split by politics, wealth and geography. Mr Johnson is the very embodiment of these divisions. His cabinet is the most privately educated for a generation. Yet as the country teeters on the cliff-edge of a hard Brexit, Mr Johnson is aware that his political base is energised by a grievance and contempt for the elite he is part of. To defuse this anger in an election that feels very close, Mr Johnson aims to sell the idea that his education policies have the potential for any child to achieve success regardless of their background. Yet the failure to think imaginatively about how education policy can address the most important issues in public life means Mr Johnson’s campaign pledges cannot be redeemed. In drawing back the curtain Mr Johnson’s government is exposed as one focused narrowly on tomorrow’s headlines rather than today’s problems – to the detriment of the country."

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.40 BST Connected as it is with ageing, it is not surprising that the menopause has a bad reputation. Even for women who have generally found their periods to be a nuisance, the cessation of the monthly cycle of egg production often comes as a shock. As well as the psychological impact of what used to euphemistically be called “the change”, the menopause brings with it symptoms for which a lot of women find themselves alarmingly unprepared – as many readers told us when we invited them to share their stories. These symptoms include the heavy or irregular bleeding that often precedes the cessation of menstruation, hot flushes and night sweats, an increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones), disrupted sleep, anxiety, vaginal dryness and reduced sex drive. Given all this, and the fact that millions of women are going through the menopause at any one time (around 1 million women in the UK take hormone replacement therapy, although four in five do not medicate), it is remarkable the extent to which the taboo surrounding the menopause remains untouched. Even as other aspects of female reproductive health have become more widely discussed, the menopause has been stuck on the shelf. So the efforts of two MPs, Labour’s Carolyn Harris and Conservative Rachel Maclean, to bring forward legislation on menopause policies at work are very welcome. Provisions such as flexible working or sick leave for women with symptoms might sound like common sense. But for many women, the experience of the menopause at work is one of discomfort exacerbated by prejudice. Even those at the highest levels are not immune. Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, recounted last week how she was once sent home after a meeting in which her (male) manager thought she looked feverish. But the truth is that even doctors do not fully understand hot flushes, while HRT has never been free of controversy. Marketed in the 1970s as a way to combat the signs of ageing, it was later revealed to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray, who was treated for breast cancer, was among those to speak out, and the numbers on HRT in the UK fell sharply. More recent guidelines state that, while women must be informed of the risks, the treatment should still be offered – with advocates pointing out that the cancer risk is minimal when compared with factors such as obesity. New concerns have been added to the old ones, with a shortage of HRT causing difficulties and an alternative treatment known as compounded bioidentical HRT, which is unregulated but widely available, under increased scrutiny following an unprecedented warning from experts. Legal entitlements for menopausal employees would provide reassurance to these women and others, while the menopause activist Meg Mathews is surely right that a storyline in one of the big TV soaps is overdue. Reflecting on her own menopause, the comedian Jennifer Saunders referred to “the indefinable something that you don’t have any more”. But the loss can also feel like a liberation – and would be a far more palatable prospect were women offered the support from employers, and society more broadly, that they deserve."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 20.52 BST As Donald Trump’s America retreats from global leadership, coalitions of like-minded nations are attempting to limit the damage. One such grouping at this weekend’s G7 summit in France managed a breakthrough over one of the globe’s most pressing problems: the accelerating deforestation in the Amazon. Conserving rainforests is necessary if there is to be any chance of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It’s not just humanity at stake – the Amazon contains at least 10% of the Earth’s biodiversity. So it was good to see France’s Emmanuel Macron take Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to task for encouraging the wanton destruction of the world’s biggest tropical forest. The rules-based order worked though Trumpish pre-emptive tweets: “Our house is burning. Literally,” wrote Mr Macron last week; “It is an international crisis,” added Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister. Mr Bolsonaro attempted to brazen it out. However, his opposition melted away as the heat was turned up over 24 hours. Mr Macron, along with Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, threatened to veto a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur, the South American economic bloc in which Brazil is the biggest player. Both European nations’ trading interests aligned with concern for the Amazon, but the pressure worked. By Friday Mr Bolsonaro had ordered the armed forces to fight a worrying spate of forest fires. Even the White House offered to help with saving the rainforest. This is a tactical victory for the planet – and one shamefully not won by the UK, which appears to be more fixated on securing its own post-Brexit trade arrangements than standing up for what is right. Much more will have to be done to change Mr Bolsonaro’s mind over the threat posed by the climate crisis. The Brazilian president, who took power in January, has appointed climate deniers to prominent roles. When the country’s National Institute for Space Research revealed increasing deforestation in the Amazon in July – a result of the rollback of environmental protections and enforcement – the president said the numbers were fake. He then sacked the head of the institute, shooting the messenger rather than acting on the message. The rate of destruction has brought the Amazon close to a dangerous threshold – where it becomes too small to generate its own clouds. As the trees disappear, rainfall declines and deforestation begins to feed on itself; this could push it to a point of no return, where the vast basin would end up resembling a savannah more than a rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro sees the Amazon as a “virgin” that should be “exploited” by big business. With the Brazilian economy still struggling to pull out of a long slump, he is looking for ways to turbocharge economic growth, but at least some of the world’s leaders have signalled – and rightly so – that this cannot be at any price for the planet. A small number of nations hold the world’s rainforests, with Brazil home to one-third and about 15% shared by Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. More tropical tree cover was lost globally in both 2016 and 2017 than in any other year this century. Preserving rainforests, and restoring former forested land, is an economical way to meet climate change targets. The G7 aid package to help Amazon countries fight wildfires is a start. But targets and protections are only effective when they are strictly applied. Europeans need to change their diets to reduce demand for carbon-intensive foodstuffs. They also ought to restrict market access unless conservation policies are reintroduced along with laws that can be enforced with transparent monitoring. The world urgently needs a new pattern of development: Brazil has become stuck in a middle-income trap, with per-capita GDP hovering around 30% of the US level. We need an economic system where the forest is valued as highly as the field, and in which natural assets are nurtured for the long term. It is a better way forward than every country putting itself first."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 19.27 BST Ben Stokes’s batting to win England the third Test match of the current Ashes series was one of the most extraordinary demonstrations of sporting excellence of the last 50 years. After bowling 25 overs on Friday, something that in itself would drain most players, he batted for five and a half hours over the following two days to turn the match around. It was not just the athleticism on display, but the mental and moral toughness required to take on a challenge which looked entirely impossible and to maintain the necessary concentration for hours on end while the pressure on him grew. This really did set an example to every spectator of the kind of self-discipline necessary to make the most of talent. Yet, as the Australian papers have been quick to point out, he needed not just his own excellence, nor just the selfless and single-minded support of Jack Leach at the other end of the wicket; he also needed the assistance of the umpire, who made a wrong decision over an lbw appeal when Stokes was two runs away from winning the match (since Australia had used up both their reviews by this point, they were unable to call for the video evidence). The mistaken lbw decision is the second time this summer that an English cricketing triumph has been secured by Mr Stokes – and by an umpiring mistake. The similarly dramatic conclusion to the one-day Cricket World Cup, which saw England beat New Zealand in a super over, was also the result of a misapplication of the rules. The super over would never have been reached had England correctly been awarded five runs rather than six when a New Zealand throw careered to the boundary off Mr Stokes’s outstretched bat as he hurled himself into the crease. Looking further back, the 1966 football World Cup final turned on the improper award of a goal against Germany by a Azerbaijani linesman, at a time – 21 years after 1945 – when few Soviet citizens would have been inclined to give a German team the benefit of any doubt. The other two were honest mistakes, of the sort that may never be entirely eliminated. They are a reminder that sporting success is seldom dependent entirely on the prowess of the competitors. Perhaps it is only solo free climbers like the astonishing Alex Honnold who can claim to be completely responsible for their own successes – but rock climbing is not an essentially competitive sport. Luck and human fallibility play a part in almost all human contests. In many sports there will always be some things which are out of the conscious control of the players. This is especially true of ball sports, where the margins of error are so small and so hard to detect that only with the advent of computers and high-speed cameras have we been able to say for certain whether a tennis serve was in or out, or a ball was heading for the stumps. No player can really know for sure, and nor can the umpire. In football, the difference between a ball which bounces off the post across the goal line and one which rebounds into play can sometimes be measured in millimetres – or in millions of pounds. In neither case is the player of the ball wholly responsible. All they can do is their best. We can admire them, and rejoice with them. But we should remember that in sport as in life the greatest triumph is never quite as glorious as it can seem – and neither is the greatest defeat quite so terrible."

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 18.48 BST Are you ready for a no-deal Brexit? Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper? Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes, just in case? Over the next few weeks, government adverts will start warning the British public, businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels. Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on 31 October, and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date, wrong, and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger. They point to the extra £2.1bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines, on ports and important freight routes, and on preparing local authorities. They argue that Boris Johnson’s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond. Even if ministers are right that their preparedness for the physical consequences of no deal are perfect, how sure are they that their colleagues are mentally ready? A number of senior Brexiteers are worried that if Britain does leave without a deal, the main problem might not be that there are what many of them optimistically term “bumps in the road”, but that MPs end up having a massive and very noisy panic attack about the whole endeavour. MPs have a tendency to panic even in small crises, calling anxiously for anyone even tangentially involved to resign so that they can at least appear to have a handle on the situation. They are much like the relatives regularly observed by doctors on geriatric wards: the ones who are the most demanding of the healthcare professionals invariably turn out to be those who failed to visit their ailing mother for years, and are now taking out their guilt on the poor nursing staff. When flooding hit the Somerset Levels in the winter of 2013-14, politicians who had paid scant attention to the activities of the Environment Agency suddenly started running around like disturbed ants. One even threatened to take Chris Smith, the boss of the quango, and “stick his head down the loo”. They’re no less brutal with their own parliamentary colleagues: ministerial resignations during bumpy periods are often seen as a way of releasing pressure, rather than actually holding someone accountable for making a mistake. It will be easy for this pattern to manifest itself again in a “bumpy” no-deal scenario. One Brexiteer fretted to me recently that “if there is no deal, journalists like you are going to find various things that have gone wrong, or a few bins that have fallen over, and then my colleagues are all going to start panicking about what no deal has done to the country, even if these problems were entirely unrelated to Brexit. They’ll start saying, ‘Oh no, this isn’t what I meant at all,’ and will then look around for someone to blame.” Another senior Tory predicts that “we might have another dodgy dossier-style situation, where you get MPs saying, ‘I only supported the evidence I was presented with, but now I’ve changed my mind.’” Johnson may find this panic hard to weather. Most Conservatives predict that he will win a vote of no confidence if the Labour party calls it in the first week of parliament sitting. But many of them worry that this result will mean the government limps on to a no-deal Brexit without having an election to clear the air. This is one of the reasons why senior Conservatives are making plans for a mid-October poll, which they hope would give Johnson the mandate to demand a new deal from Brussels. There is also the rather obvious blame game going on between the British government and its European counterparts. If there is no deal, Johnson will want to say it was recalcitrant EU leaders who forced Britain out in this way. Similarly European negotiators want to impress upon anyone who will listen that Britain is already dead set on leaving without a deal, and is only throwing up silly suggestions on the backstop that it knows could never work. If the EU fails as a convenient scapegoat, No 10 can also blame the May government for failing to prepare properly, and remainers in parliament for undermining the negotiations. This will drive an even deeper wedge through the Conservative party. Most ministerial attention is currently focused on what the first two weeks of September will bring, rather than on how MPs might behave in November. There are some plans to try to stop parliamentarians panicking. Michael Gove is likely to do weekly statements to the House of Commons on no-deal preparations, so MPs can’t say they weren’t informed, and the prime minister is holding regular dinners with MPs. Johnson on Sunday tried to prepare his colleagues and the public, saying: “I do not want at this stage to say there won’t be unforeseen difficulties.” His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been pushing ministerial aides to look for possible problems in their own departments in order to avoid a “black swan event” – an unexpected and severe crisis. The problem with genuine black swans, though, is that they only ever appear obvious once they have surfaced. Anything special advisers find now isn’t what will cause them the most trouble in the future. All they can do is hope that the most unexpected thing of all happens, which is that MPs don’t conform to their usual pattern, and manage not to panic. • Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator"

After the apocalyptic vision of post-Brexit Britain revealed last week in the leak of Operation Yellowhammer, we learn that the government will spend £4m on “local resilience forums” across England (and £1.7m for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) supporting Brexit preparations for public services. The reasonably sane response might be – what public services? Central government funding for local government will have fallen by 56% in the 10 years to 2020. Or, to put a more human face on it, 1.4 million older people are not receiving the home care they need, 155 women and 103 children are turned away by refuges every day and hundreds of libraries, youth services, Sure Starts and day centres are closing weekly. At the current rate, the main job of resilience forums will be putting up yet more shutters. All of which affects both men and women but no change is gender neutral in the damage it inflicts. Women have already paid a far heavier price from austerity and, deal or no deal, worse is to come. So who will speak up? If women counted, what kind of an economy might we have? Wednesday 18 September sees the 30th birthday of the Women’s Budget Group (WBG), an independent thinktank that is now part of a global network of feminist economists who are growing in influence, particularly in places where there is an insightful leader such as New Zealand, with Jacinda Ardern. In May, her government introduced a wellbeing budget. Billed as the first in the world, it allocated millions to child poverty and narrowing the inequality gap. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the New Zealand economy will grow by 2.9% next year. In the UK, it was the sight of John Major, the then chancellor of the exchequer, carrying his red box on budget day in 1989 that prompted a group of feminist economists, trade unionists and activists to set up the WBG. Its purpose was to demonstrate what a non-gender-blind approach to economics might look like and to encourage women to take a bigger part in the economic debate. It’s our future too. What do gender-blind policies mean in practical terms? One example: transport. The cumulative cuts in fuel duty will cost the exchequer £9bn a year by 2020. The Treasury says this is gender neutral: both men and women drive. But men are more likely to own cars, drive cars with higher fuel consumption and go longer distances. At the same time, public transport, on which women rely more than men, has received so little investment that the sight of a bus in rural areas is a rare event. Another example: unequal pay means that no single woman on median earnings can afford to buy or rent an averagely priced house in any region in England. Average rent takes 43% of a woman’s median earnings, 28% of men’s. And a third: we have a growing crisis in care because this precious commodity is valued so poorly. Between 2005 and 2014, the number of hours of unpaid care rose by 25% from 6.5bn to 8.1bn hours a year – that’s mainly women’s work – at the same time as debt and low wages mean women have to hold on to employment, however insecure. “Women are disproportionately affected … as a result of structural inequalities which mean they earn less and have more responsibility for unpaid care and domestic work,” says Prof Diane Elson, chair of WBG’s commission on a gender-equal economy that reports next year. “It doesn’t have to be like this. Our positive vision for an alternative economy puts care and wellbeing of people and planet front and centre.” Under New Labour, urged on by feminist ministers, WBG had a major influence on, for instance, working tax credit and the need to consider the gender impact on policies (a statutory duty easily ignored). Since then, the road has become rockier domestically. The European Union, however, has passed several beneficial laws for women’s employment. So what next? WBG argues not for “a budget for women” but for “an economy for human beings” that works more effectively and fairly. One day, let’s hope “women’s issues” are extinct, replaced by an understanding that pro-equality policies work more effectively both for women and men, for social cohesion and for the environment. “Classical economics is based on the independent man who works full time and is in control,” says Mary-Ann Stephenson, WBG’s director. “But life isn’t like that. We are all interdependent. It’s part of what it means to be human. We will all give or receive care at some time in our lives. So we need a system in which care is a fundamental part of the economy and the unpaid economy is fully recognised as having value.” In 1988, Marilyn Waring, a former New Zealand MP, wrote If Women Counted, criticising the use of gross domestic product as a system that “counts oil spills and wars as a contributor to economic growth, while child rearing and housekeeping are deemed valueless”. A woman in Africa who toils 18 hours a day on the land and for her family is classed in manmade economics as “unoccupied”. Why, Waring asked, does water going through a pipe have a market value but not water carried on a woman’s head? In the same vein, the WBG argues that attention should be paid to what it calls social infrastructure – for instance, investment in social care – in addition to investment in roads and rail. This isn’t a “women’s issue” – it makes economic sense. If the UK invested 2% of GDP in the care sector, it would create 1.5m jobs; the same investment creates 750,00 jobs in construction. “Can you imagine the nation’s annual budget becoming a realistic description of wellbeing of the community and its environment, a reflection of real wealth and different values?” Waring wrote in 1988. The members of WBG not only imagine just such a society, they pursue it with the kind of academic rigour and economic expertise that reveals the real price we all pay for continued injustice and inequality – and how there is a better alternative. May WBG have the best of birthdays. • Yvonne Roberts is a freelance journalist, writer and broadcaster"

Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 20.08 BST It’s basically your classic men-of-the-world vignette. Lying in business dress in the New York mansion of his friend Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew is receiving a foot massage from a young, well-dressed Russian woman. Other men are in the room while this is happening, and they include Epstein (also being foot-massaged by a Russian woman) and the literary agent John Brockman, who runs a foundation connecting scientists and intellectuals with billionaires. As the young Russians work on their feet, Andy is complaining about his lot. “In Monaco,” he says, according to Brockman’s account, “[Prince] Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I’m in big trouble.” Waa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!” The scene is recalled in an email revealed by Brockman’s soon-to-be former client, the tech author Evgeny Morozov. He is one of many divesting themselves of even tenuous Epstein association in the wake of the billionaire financier’s suicide in a Manhattan jail earlier this month, as he awaited trial for sex trafficking, underage and otherwise. But what of Andy? Under some scrutiny, he and ex-wife Duchess Fergie private-jetted away from Balmoral last week, then on to the luxury bit of Sotogrande, where they are said to be gracing private barbecues. Briefings suggest, distractingly, that they might be getting back together. Andrew has been snapped on an exclusive golf course. His daughter Princess Beatrice might be getting engaged to her boyfriend. “They’re going to get married,” royal expert Ingrid Seward declared this week, divertingly. “I was told by a member of the family.” So, on go the Yorks. It really is the full fairytale. By which I mean: fairly Grimm. Back to the foot massage scene, then, where the chaps seem to have got on to Prince Albert’s night-time freedom via the subject of Julian Assange. Brockman reports Andy saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like northern England as opposed to southern Europe.” Is the implication that Swedish authorities investigating sexual assault allegations are being illiberal? Either way, you don’t get all that nanny state stuff on Epstein’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”. Or as Buckingham Palace finally put it in a statement denying any impropriety on behalf of the prince: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.” I’m slightly sorry for the royal flunkies who had to issue this line, given that most of us are suffering eyeball strain from all the rolling we’re doing. Even so, I do feel we need further clarification on what precisely the Duke is appalled by. Is it just the “recent reports”? Because if we’re meant to believe that Prince Andrew is appalled by ALL of the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein – both the ones alleged and the ones he served actual jail time for – then allow me to treat this statement with all the dignity it deserves. To wit: BULL. SHIT. Bullshit Prince Andrew didn’t know what sort of guy his friend was when he was snapped walking with the Tier 1 sex offender, after he got out of jail, in a photo the New York Post headlined “PRINCE & PERV”. Bullshit he didn’t know why his close friend WENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR, but kept hanging out with him anyway. Bullshit if, as Brockman recounts, he lay on his back in that guy’s house, with a Russian attending to his feet, talking over her head to men of the world about the nocturnal licence afforded to minor European royals, and he didn’t know roughly what he was swimming in. Bullshit. I get we have to pay for Andrew’s lifetime of jollies; but we don’t have to have our intelligence insulted by him. I’m not even going to wheel out that old writing device where one says that either Prince Andrew is stupid or deeply compromised, and wonder archly which it is. Guys, he can be both! In fact, the one feeds the other. The plain fact is that Andrew continued to be friends with Epstein even after he pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. I guess it was the old she-said, he-said thing. Or as the then-Palm Beach police chief put it: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the shes all basically told the same story.” Obviously, Epstein got away lightly with his grotesque plea deal, because 50-something:1 isn’t the ratio you need. Even last year, they still needed 60 accusers to stop Bill Cosby. Donald Trump’s 17:1 she-he ratio is nowhere near enough to keep him from the highest office on the planet. As for where we go from here, perhaps a multimillion-pound royal wedding would indeed be helpful. It should be quite the opposite. Where Princess Anne pointedly didn’t, Prince Andrew demanded all the titles and trappings for his two daughters – security details, civil list money, full royal weddings – and was furious when denied some of them. Yet Beatrice and Eugenie still live like … well, princesses. So instead of distracting from the miserable stories of the female attendees of various Epstein mansions, these gilded lives should throw them into even more shameful relief. They suggest the kind of man – and we’ve all met them – who has a two-tier view of the female sex. There is a world for their daughters, hopefully insulated from men like their friend Jeffrey, and then there is another world for the girls who service their friend Jeffrey. Yet decent, humane people know there aren’t two kinds of women and girls – there are just women and girls. I’m reminded of the climactic line in All My Sons, where the wartime profiteer Joe Keller has been finally made – by his own son’s suicide note – to see how his actions were responsible for the fate of so many other young men. “I think to him they were all my sons,” Keller reflects. “And I guess they were. I guess they were.” And so with the girls in the stories that swirl around Epstein and his circle, which includes the Duke: either broken, or yet-to-be-broken. But ultimately, breakable. They are all daughters, too, your Royal Highness. The Russian masseuse on your feet, the 17-year-old runaway on whose bare hip you have your hand in that fateful picture in London, the terrified 14-year-old who ran screaming from your great friend’s house in her underwear, who you must have read about at the time, because I did, and I didn’t even know the guy. And all the others. They are each someone’s daughter, or they were once. They all once played at princesses and castles and imagined their own fairytale weddings. Funny how dreams die, isn’t it – and who helps to crush them. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/fires-are-devouring-the-amazon-and-jair-bolsonaro-is-to-blame,"The ongoing destruction of the Amazon is taking place because of policy choices made by those who now rule Brazil Mon 26 Aug 2019 07.00 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.15 BST As the world watches in horror and terror as the Amazon burns, scientists have made clear that the cause, principally if not entirely, is human activity. Here in Brazil, that human activity has human names and faces: those of Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, and his extremist environment minister, Ricardo Salles. They have not merely permitted these devastating fires, but have encouraged and fueled them. They have done so with a toxic brew of radical ideology, political corruption and banal greed. Put simply, the ongoing destruction of the Amazon is taking place because of policy choices made by those who now rule Brazil. The magnitude of these fires, and the severity of the dangers they pose to the world, have been widely demonstrated over the last week. As the New York Times reported on Wednesday, the National Institute for Space Research documented that it “had detected 39,194 fires this year in the world’s largest rain forest, a 77% increase from the same period in 2018”. The raging fires have become so potent that the smoke they generate plunged the western hemisphere’s largest city, São Paulo, into total darkness in the middle of the day on Tuesday. What was particularly shocking about that sudden event was that the Amazonian fires are hundreds of miles away from that city, but have become so dense and overwhelming that they snuffed out light in that distant major metropolis. To the extent one can locate any silver lining in this literal dark cloud, it is that the cause of these fires are almost entirely manmade, which means they can be stopped with changes in human behavior – specifically, with policy changes by Brazil’s new government. Bolsonaro’s election victory last November was a shock to the Brazilian political system because, as a congressman for almost 30 years, his retrograde and unhinged views had relegated him to the fringe of politics life. His presence in the congress was regarded by most as a national embarrassment; that he would one day occupy the presidential palace was unthinkable. But as has happened in numerous other countries in the democratic world, including the US, a series of crises and failures validly attributed to the establishment class have driven large sections of the country’s population into the arms of any self-styled outsider, no matter how demagogic and radical. Among Bolsonaro’s many extremist views is climate denialism as stubborn and extreme as any prominent world figure, if not more so. He has long dismissed the scientific consensus about climate scenarios as a hoax. And he campaigned on an explicit pledge to exploit – ie destroy – the Amazon, which currently provides 20% of the world’s oxygen and which climate scientists widely regard as the most valuable asset humanity possesses in our increasingly difficult battle to avoid climate catastrophes. Since his election, Bolsonaro has not only made good on his promises to fundamentally subvert our country’s long-standing commitment to protect the Amazon, but has done so with a speed and aggression that has surprised even his most virulent critics. To be sure, Bolsonaro’s predecessors – including those from the center-left Workers’ Party – have earned their share of valid criticisms from environmentalists for harming the Amazon for industrial gain. But – after just eight moths in office – Bolsonaro’s damage to the world’s greatest rain forest is in an entirely different universe of magnitude. Deforestation is an affirmative goal of Bolsonaro. That can be achieved by cutting down trees or, more efficiently, by simply burning large areas that Brazil’s agricultural industry wants to exploit. It also means displacing the indigenous tribes that have lived in those forests for centuries: people for whom Bolsonaro has repeatedly expressed contempt. Their displacement from those lands has often been accomplished with violence against environmental activists and indigenous leaders. Bolsonaro’s choice for his environment minster, Ricardo Salles from the so-called New Party (Partido Novo), exemplifies the radical and even violent anti-environmentalism fueling these fires. Last year, Salles, while serving as a state environmental official in São Paulo, was found guilty of administrative improprieties for having altered a map to benefit mining companies. He was fined and deprived of his political rights – including his right to seek elected office – for eight years. Bolsonaro evidently viewed these transgressions as a virtue since he announced his selection of Salles to serve in his cabinet a mere three weeks after his conviction. In 2018, Salles – now the custodian of the Brazilian Amazon – ran for federal Congress with a political ad that displayed bullets from a rifle as his solution for environmental activists, indigenous tribes impeding the destruction of their land, and “leftists”. Salles lost his bid for congress, but was rewarded with a much more powerful position: Bolsonaro’s environment minister. Bolsonaro and Salles view deforestation as such a pressing priority that they openly despise anyone who seeks to impede it. Earlier this month, Bolsonaro fired a top scientist after he warned the country that deforestation was taking place at an unprecedented and dangerous rate. Last month, when a reporter asked Bolsonaro about the damage being done to the environment by his industrial policies, the president contemptuously told the reporter he should defecate less: “One day yes, one day no.” And, in the face of rising political pressure over the Amazonian fires, he infamously, and baselessly, blamed environmental groups this week for having started them. The agencies charged with safeguarding the nearly one million indigenous people in Brazil have suffered such severe budget cuts under Bolsonaro that they are now barely functioning. During the campaign, he vowed: “Not one centimetre will be demarcated for indigenous reserves or quilombolas.” In late July, gold miners invaded an indigenous village and one of its leaders was stabbed to death. All of these dramatic changes have occurred not only from ideology but also political captivity. Along with rightwing evangelicals and supporters of Brazil’s past military dictatorship, Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector is a critical component of the coalition that swept Bolsonaro into office. Their gamble on Bolsonaro has paid dividends: a huge array of previously banned pesticides has been approved for use this year with virtually no debate or study. One result: the death of 500 million bees in the last three months alone. Worst of all, deforestation is consuming the Amazon at a horrifically rapid pace. As the New York Times put it this week: “The destruction of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has increased rapidly since the nation’s new far-right president took over and his government scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, ranching and mining.” The government agency responsible for monitoring deforestation documented the loss of “1,330 sq miles of forest cover in the first half of 2019, a 39% increase over the same period last year”. What the world is witnessing is as deliberate as it is dangerous. It is insufficient, and arguably offensive, for already developed and rich western powers which have done so much damage to the planet to simply dictate to Brazil that it must not exploit its resources the way the west has done with such great environmental damage. But the world also cannot stand by and let the Bolsonaro government destroy the Amazon. In lieu of unilateral decrees that smack of arrogant colonialism, rich industrialized countries who need the Amazon to survive should fund social programs for poor Brazilians who compose a large majority of our supremely unequal country, in exchange for preservation of this vital environmental asset. Identifying the culprit – Bolsonaro and Salles – is necessary but not sufficient to avert the environmental disaster. The Amazon belongs to Brazil, but the need to save the planet belongs to all of humanity, and all of us must bear this burden collectively.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 11.00 BST What makes a town thrive? When people are choosing where to live in Britain in 2019, they are doing so at a time when many places are undergoing dramatic changes. With retail shifting online and traditional industries declining, many towns that once had thriving high streets and commercial centres are experiencing a loss of confidence and a changing sense of identity. The latest report commissioned by Arts Council England, based on independent research, shows that arts and culture are up there with good schools when people make their decisions about where to live. There is not only tangible value in investment in the arts, but also huge public demand for it. Of those surveyed, 44% said the local arts scene is an important factor, compared with 43% saying the same about schools. These are striking figures. The presence of a theatre, a gallery or a library – places where people gather to enjoy themselves and share an experience – can help to sustain towns through the transformations of our age. They can generate local pride and help to forge a new identity based on creativity, while still celebrating their past. As one Stoke-on-Trent resident interviewed for the report stated, having a strong cultural offer “gives the impression that an area respects itself and its historical and cultural heritage”. This kind of community self-esteem is crucial. Performances, exhibitions and festivals can arrest decline and help to make town centres attractive places to visit and socialise. The figures in the report support this, with 68% of people saying that arts and cultural events are very important for fostering community feeling. The most obvious example of the positive impact of art and culture in recent years is the experience of Hull, when it was City of Culture in 2017. The programme boosted the city’s economy, with £300m generated by the local tourism industry across the year. However, the benefits went far beyond that, helping to instil in local people a renewed pride in Hull’s history and confidence about its role in the world. By the end of the year, three-quarters of residents said they were proud to live in the city. Hull’s experience has been mirrored by that of smaller towns across the country, including a wide range of market, coastal and post-industrial towns. Since 2012, the Arts Council has invested £53m in Creative People and Places – a programme designed to bring cultural events to areas with low levels of arts engagement – with a further £17.5m announced earlier this month. By working with residents and local partners, the scheme allows people to shape the arts and cultural provision where they live. So far, the scheme has supported projects in 21 areas across England including Sunderland, St Helens, Barking and Luton. These projects can help to give residents a new perspective on where they live. One project, which saw Hanley Park in Stoke-on-Trent turned into a pyrotechnic circus, drew in many local people who were visiting for the first time, despite the park being on their doorstep. “People are seeing it as a beautiful space to be used for recreation purposes rather than just a shortcut,” said one person. As towns such as Margate and Folkestone show, a thriving cultural sector can also help to attract new businesses working in creative industries (this is the fastest growing sector of the UK economy, with the number of creative jobs increasing by 30% since 2011). Since opening its doors nearly a decade ago, Turner Contemporary art gallery has attracted 400,000 visitors a year, injecting over £68m into Kent’s economy, and leading to the opening of more than 150 businesses across Margate. In the summer of 2018, 35% of visitors stated they visited Margate specifically to visit the gallery. The establishment of Folkestone Triennial exhibition and the development of the “creative quarter” in the town has similarly shown that the arts can draw people to destinations they might not otherwise have considered, turning town centres into busy places to visit and generating increased footfall for local businesses. As well as considering the benefits to communities, people are also drawn to places with a strong artistic offering because they recognise the value of creativity to themselves as individuals. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of people think that arts and culture are good for wellbeing, and 36% think arts and culture are “essential to life”. People who attended a wide range of arts and cultural events reported higher levels of satisfaction with their lives than those who did not, even after accounting for other factors that influence life satisfaction. This is also borne out by the evaluation of the City of Culture programme in Hull, where over 90% of the residents took part in a cultural activity during the year, 80% of whom said that being part of the project made them feel happier. The hard evidence shows that the arts matter to people across the country, and makes clear the case for greater investment in culture. It was heartening to see Boris Johnson recognise this in one of his first speeches as prime minister, when he drew attention to the benefits that investment in the arts had brought to the reputation, the life and the economy of Manchester over the past 20 years. Whether it is in bringing communities together, promoting individual wellbeing, or helping towns to adapt to changing economic circumstances, the arts have an ever-increasing role to play in helping us all to live well. By supporting our cultural sector, we create happier, more vibrant communities that we can all be proud to be a part of. • Nicholas Serota is chair of Arts Council England"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/25/racist-abuse-in-the-real-world-is-in-decline-so-why-not-on-twitter,"The social media platform is still failing to root out its vilest and most hateful users Sun 25 Aug 2019 08.00 BST Britain is a much less racist country than the one I grew up in. Yet I have received more racist abuse in the last four weeks than the previous 40 years. This paradox can be explained in a single word: technology. More specifically, Twitter. It helps to explain why, last week, social media once again became the key battleground for tacking racism. Growing up, my experiences of racism were pretty banal. If you called me a “paki” in the playground, you could expect a sarcastic lecture about the need to get an atlas, as my dad is from India. Nobody ever hit me but as a football-mad teenager in the 1980s, I heard shocking racism, which was eventually stamped out by the mid-1990s. Monkey chanting in the ground has given way to hatred on social media – see the racist abuse against Paul Pogba of Manchester United and other leading black players which hit the headlines last week. It is more than 20 years since anyone was racist to my face and I would rarely encounter racism at all if I weren’t on Twitter. But I am an addict. The platform can even tell me that I have sent more than 180,000 tweets over the last 11 years. I’ve found it an enormously positive experience, although worrying about the growing incivility of public discourse led me to invent #positivetwitterday in 2012, promoting it in an unusual alliance with blogger Guido Fawkes. This annual fixture, on the last Friday in August, challenges tweeters to behave civilly for at least one day, a symbolic way to deepen the conversation about what we can all do to shape the social media culture that we want. I’m pleased that this year Twitter is also supporting it. So users can shift the tone of online discourse, but the racist firestorm I’ve experienced this month demonstrates why social media companies must play their part. Ironically, this began when I shared some good news about progress on race: an Observer report on research that nine out of 10 people don’t think you have to be white to be English. That sort of social change is a welcome message for, well, about nine out of 10 people. Several hundred people retweeted and liked the tweet, but I also heard how angry the most toxic members of that shrinking racist minority felt about it. I decided to report the racial abuse that I received to Twitter’s systems, something I had never done before. The results were illuminating. I reported about 50 racist users that weekend. About a third were deemed out of order; two-thirds were judged to be OK. What sorts of racism does Twitter let users get away with? You probably won’t get away with calling somebody “nigger”, but I was told by Twitter that “You are not British, parjeet – you people are shitting in the street” was acceptable. I emailed back to ask what more the user had to say to break the “hateful conduct” rules. A response just said it had been checked and upheld. I wondered how often a human being was reading my messages – and how often an algorithm. Getting these boundaries right is difficult. I want Twitter to do more against racists, but I don’t think they should ban Donald Trump, for example – though some of his tweets might have to go. With the aim of at least educating users, I began a new hashtag, #doesnotviolate, to promote transparency about what gets allowed. Twitter says it abhors racism on the platform, but its current rules permit racism and racist speech, only banning users who promote violence or make threats or harassment on racial grounds. It did tighten its anti-hatred policies this month and dehumanising tweets against faith groups now violate the rules. Twitter gave examples: “We need to exterminate the rats; the Jews are disgusting” would now be out of order. I was astonished that it wasn’t already. Yet say exactly the same thing about black people and it’s still OK. That is, tweets dehumanising racial groups are deemed by Twitter to still be acceptable. Changing their policies on this is an urgent necessity. Racists banned from football grounds can’t just turn up again the following weekend, but hundreds of virulent racist accounts banned from Twitter openly celebrate how easily they flout that. New rules won’t help if Twitter can’t enforce them. Solidarity from other tweeters included sending me astonishing evidence of just how repeatedly those orchestrating harassment of me had been banned. A virulent antisemite using the handle “Noxious Jew” openly boasts about being the same banned user. Twitter allowed him to reregister dozens of his vile variations, such as “Fetid Jew”, “Pungent Jew”, “Malodorous Jew”, with messages sarcastically hashtagged #myfirsttweet asking his racist network to rebuild his audience. I sent that to Twitter’s enforcement team and got an email back saying it could not find any violation of its rules. Racists banned from football grounds can’t just turn up again the following weekend, but hundreds of virulent racist accounts banned from Twitter openly celebrate how easily they flout that. Twitter needs to combine technology and human capacity to sort this out. Is reporting online racism futile? “Just block and move on,” I was told. But the answer to racism in football grounds wasn’t earplugs for black and Asian fans. We changed the culture at the grounds. It is a mistake to think of “online” and “offline” as hermetically sealed worlds. If we don’t emulate the progress we made in playgrounds and stadiums on social media this organised effort to relegitimise racism on social media will leak back into society. Phil Neville, manager of the England’s women’s team, proposes a six-month boycott by footballers. But I don’t want to leave the platform. Instead, it must be time for Twitter to show racism the red card and to mean it. • Sunder Katwala is director of British Future"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.54 BST A bell tolled five times and then a loud, heavy metal drumbeat played through the PA system of the main hall of the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster. Five-hundred prospective Brexit party parliamentary candidates rose as one to greet their messiah in the very building where he had announced his retirement from frontline politics just three years earlier. Nigel Farage milked the acclaim as he slowly walked down the aisle from the back of the auditorium. “Are you ready?” he yelled when he finally stepped up on stage. “We’re ready,” came the response. “ARE YOU READY?” “WE’RE READY.” But ready for what? Farage’s stated aim is for him and his party not to exist. To be an irrelevance. Yet everything he does reeks of someone who can’t bear anonymity. The thought of being the lonely pub bore, tugging on a Rothmans in the outside smoking area, handing out dodgy share tips to any unlucky passerby, scares him. He needs the attention. And with every new reinvention of himself, he becomes ever more grandiose. And terrifying. Back in his Ukip days, Farage could connect with people by not appearing to take himself too seriously. For this second coming, everything about him feels slick and manicured. He has become the very embodiment of the establishment politician he claims to despise. The professional populist, surrounded by acolytes and opportunists, who feeds off misery and only really feels alive when he is at the centre of a well-orchestrated rally where candidates have been seated by region. Though much of his betrayal narrative is still very familiar, the goalposts have steadily been shifted. First it was enough for the country to have voted to leave the EU. Now only the hardest of hard Brexits will satisfy him. And even if that were to be on offer then he would probably find some reason to reject it. Because a perfect Brexit would only spiral him back into obscurity. The Platonic ideal is not on his agenda. With the audience whooping at the end of every sentence – NI-GEL, NI-GEL – Farage moved to the business in hand. Basically, he was pretty pissed off with Boris Johnson. Not just for having nicked most of the Brexit party’s policies – cancelling HS2, not handing over the £39bn we owe the EU and being a bit more beastly to foreigners by cutting the aid budget – but for being the better snake-oil salesman. He just couldn’t bear it that he was still niche while Boris was now mainstream. In this new world order, Farage would achieve immortality. Possibly even divinity So here was his offer. He had assembled 500 of the brightest and the best of the Brexit party’s crack troops – step forward Jay Aston from Bucks Fizz. And fingers crossed none of them turned out to have posted racist comments on social media in the past. He was ready to take on the Tories at the forthcoming election if Johnson showed any sign of trying to palm off any version of Theresa May’s deal, with or without the backstop, on the country. But if – and only if – Boris was prepared to go full no deal then Farage would support him by offering a “non-aggression pact”. Here the rally threatened to go full Nuremberg. It wasn’t clear if Farage saw himself as Hitler and Johnson as Stalin or vice versa, but the previous non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939 hadn’t ended particularly well for Poland. The UK had voted for Brexit and the people were going to get the Brexit they were given whether they liked it or not. For poorer or for even poorer. Boris and Nigel would carve up the country between them. A new sovereign state that would last for 1,000 years or more. The election to end all elections. Prorogation would be a small price to pay for Brexiters taking back control. And the EU would have to bow before us because without the UK they would be nothing. The cheers were deafening. In this new world order, Farage would achieve immortality. Possibly even divinity. Elsewhere, there was the merest hint of a rebel alliance with a cross-party agreement to block no deal and a no-prorogation declaration at Church House. Its only fault was that it all felt too polite, too rational, too parliamentary. Too little even, as no one can agree what happens next after no deal. Revoke article 50? A second referendum? May’s deal? Or some other, as yet unspecified deal? No one knows. Which makes the opposition parties and Conservative no-deal refuseniks all too easy for demagogues such as Johnson and Farage to pick off one by one. Brand them as traitors, enemies of the people, and the job is done. Westminster politics is getting uglier by the day. The opposition needs to wise up and learn how to play dirty."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.15 BST On the whole it had been a rather agreeable bank holiday weekend in Biarritz. Some of the assembled world leaders might have been a bit meh and it was always disconcerting coming face to face with someone with an even greater personality disorder than your own but by and large everyone had rubbed along OK. Factor in the great morning swims, the food being better than expected, that he had even managed not to spill any wine on the sofa and this was pretty much how Boris Johnson had always imagined being prime minister would be. Plenty of photo ops, high-level schmoozing and no obligation to do anything much at all. Just fun, fun, fun and endless music for the thirsty narcissistic soul. The beauty of the G7 summit was that it was perfectly tailored to everyone’s needs. Each leader could come away with their own personal wellness experience of what had actually happened without fear of being contradicted. If you wanted it to have been about Iran that was OK. And if you wanted it to have been about marine conservation that was OK too. Much like a Gwyneth Paltrow-curated five-star spiritual retreat on Necker Island, only without the hassle of having to interact with Richard Branson. Still, all good things must come to an end and Johnson was in a hurry to get back to the UK. There was just one problem: he was due to give a press conference and the podium was currently occupied by Donald Trump who had decided to close the G7 with an hour-long, free-association therapy session. Yes, the US president was very much looking forward to hosting next year’s summit at his Miami retreat because everyone would have their own bungalow and there was plenty of parking. Yes, he might invite Vladimir Putin but there again he might not. Yes, he couldn’t see what the problem with the Northern Ireland backstop was because the Republic of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. He knew that because he had a golf course there. Not that he was obsessed about money and property, but being president had cost him $5bn and he was paid zippo for public speaking. And why didn’t people talk so much about Englandland these days? Boris? Great guy. He didn’t know why he hadn’t been made prime minister six years ago. Possibly because there hadn’t been a vacancy in 2013. Johnson’s irritation at having his plane held up on the runway gradually gave way to a sense of calm. The advantage of being the next guy up after someone who is certifiable is that almost anything he said would sound sane in comparison. Once Trump had finally been dragged off stage there was a 20-minute recovery period for reporters before Boris delivered his own comedown debrief from his Ayahuasca experience. The G7 had marked a huge step forward for the Sumatran tiger, he declared. And he loved the environment so much he was going to give it £10m. Roughly the same amount he’d put aside for alimony. Predictably, no one was much interested in the intensity of the prime minister’s drug-induced hallucinations. What they really wanted to know was what he was intending to do about Brexit. Here Johnson’s zen-like mask of self-realisation began to slip and the furtive, guilty smirk crossed his face. Because the whole point of Brexit was that he didn’t actually have a plan. Other than to gaslight the country with a succession of competing and contradictory visions. On one day a no-deal Brexit might be a million to one shot and on the next it might be the most likely outcome. He might withhold the £39bn or he might hand it over. Whatever it took to get him through the day and to keep everyone guessing. After all, this wasn’t so much about getting Brexit done as keeping him in power for as long as possible. He liked the house, he liked the privilege and he couldn’t bear to be parted from them so soon. And if he didn’t know what he was doing, then none of the other EU leaders would know either. Politics as a form of fetishistic, sexual role play. Only with no safe word. “Pifflepafflewifflewaffle,” Johnson said, as he was asked several times about his willingness to prorogue parliament. Maybe yes, maybe no. He was like the wind. And no he couldn’t imagine why Philip Hammond might have thought No 10 had briefed that he had leaked the no-deal documents. The very idea. Johnson breathed deeply, willing himself to flash back to his altered state of consciousness. One where he was at one with himself and the world. He promised to take just two more questions but only took one. So easy to lose count. Besides, nothing was more important than maintaining the G7 vibe of Club 45-70. And chill. The comedown could wait another day."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 18.00 BST The threatened expulsion of small town Bury from the English Football League – which could happen if the owner, Steve Dale, does not conclude a sale of the club by 5pm on Tuesday – has been a touch more emotional for me than many of the football traumas I have investigated as a journalist over the past 20 years. I grew up in north Manchester, five miles down the road, and went to school in Bury. Twice a day I used to pass the club’s Gigg Lane ground and wonder at it from the top of the 35 bus: a proper football home, bedded in with all its history behind a pleasing line of trees. In these crisis-stricken months for Bury, a club founded in 1885, many people have rightly pointed with bewilderment to English football’s violent inequalities; to Manchester City and United 10 miles away, owned by overseas billionaires, making multimillionaires of their players and managers. Supporters have despaired at the gaping holes in football’s governance, its painfully limited “fit and proper persons test” for owners, so long campaigned for but that still fails to protect beloved clubs from needless ruination. Since the coalition government formed in 2010, Bury council has suffered cuts of £85m, 61% of its annual budget But the details of Bury’s crumbling expose an alarming, knacker’s-yard wreckage that is more broadly worrying for the economies of Britain’s old industrial places at this time of imminent national shock. Football, the national sport, has always reflected the country and its times. When Bury, Bolton, Blackburn, Preston and other north-west and Midlands towns formed the late-Victorian professional clubs, they were powerhouses of mills and manufacturing. The former public schoolboys who founded the Football Association in London in 1863 remained amateurs and opposed professionalism for years – partly because they did not need the money to compensate them for time off to train and play. Today, the ruins of Bury FC expose the wider vulnerability of its surrounding town and many places like it around the country on the brink of Brexit: a disruption engineered by politicians who never took the bus to school, apparently incubating extreme ideologies for a country from which they were always kept detached. Bury’s financial instability was evident for five years under the previous owner, Stewart Day, a Blackburn-based property developer specialising in accommodation blocks for students. In 2014 his company borrowed money secured on Gigg Lane at 10% interest a month, which compounded into 138% annual interest. That, sadly, did not clang enough alarm bells and Day continued building his flats, and loading borrowings on to Bury, until it all collapsed. When he announced in December that he had sold the club to Dale, for £1, Day said he wanted to spend more time with his family, while Dale spoke of it as a philanthropic venture. Day’s financial difficulties were laid bare within weeks, as his companies fell into insolvency and administration. Some people involved in new or expanding universities in northern former mill towns have described their growth as economic regeneration, but it has always seemed shaky to base a recovery on government-backed loans taken out by young people facing uncertain futures. Day’s property ventures were not even supported by banks; he had borrowed heavily from Lendy, a model based on attracting money from thousands of individual investors, which has itself collapsed and is now subject to a Financial Conduct Authority investigation. Day also pre-sold individual flats, promising guaranteed returns from students’ rent payments, and many investors are now distraught at seeing life savings lost. At Bury itself, loans now up to £3.7m, secured on Gigg Lane, were taken from an outfit called Capital Bridging Finance Solutions, based in Crosby, with 40% commissions paid to still-unnamed third parties as introduction fees. The publicly filed documents state that Capital in turn mortgaged Bury’s ground to a company registered in Malta, whose own lenders for the deal were eight companies domiciled in the offshore tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. Perhaps you have to know and have been to Gigg Lane, a football haven amid terraced streets just off Manchester Road, to feel in your guts the ludicrous nature of such house-of-cards economics. A further look at Dale’s business record revealed a trader in insolvent companies that had mostly been dissolved or liquidated. Any philanthropic intentions were overtaken by his voluble complaining at the financial hole vacated by Day. On the way to Bury’s own insolvency Dale laid off hardworking staff and failed to pay £4m of creditors including £1.1m to HMRC, as well as players who are still owed substantial back wages. Bury’s council leader, David Jones, told the Guardian last week that losing the club would be a “nail in the coffin” for the town. Since David Cameron and Nick Clegg formed their coalition government in 2010, the council has suffered cuts of £85m, 61% of its annual budget, he said. Boris Johnson is now presenting a no-deal Brexit as easy to cope with, when the government’s own assessment is that the north-west’s already patchy and unequal economy will suffer a -12% hit. That is the broader context of the Bury collapse and its defining image: the former director Joy Hart, chaining herself to a drainpipe outside the club’s closed offices, pleading for salvation. • David Conn is a Guardian writer"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 18.55 BST The prime minister is making stuff up about pork pies and the president of the United States wants to nuke hurricanes, but amid the late summer madness, we – we the people – have Ben Stokes. On a blazing bank holiday weekend for the ages, the hero of Headingley near single-handedly (for we must not forget the bespectacled, brilliant Jack Leach) provided a moment of respite from the catastrophic chaos the powers that be seem all too happy to unleash upon their citizenry. Just to be clear, here is what the immigrant Ben Stokes is not: he is not a distillation of the “Dunkirk spirit”, to be co-opted by nostalgic disaster merchants keen to claim credit for all that is good and wander back off to the champagne tent to inspect their portfolios when it goes tits up. He is, rather, an elite sportsman – an expert, if you will – who spectacularly adapted his play to navigate a way through the trickiest of situations. Unlike those in potentially analogous circumstances, Stokes had the time he needed: but what he still had to find were skill, nerve and, perhaps most importantly, respect for the game he was playing and the opponents he faced. There’s a lesson there. And after a period of calculated defensiveness, he got busy. For those watching in the ground and on screens everywhere, it was a masterclass in digging in and knowing when to deploy the flair, the risky reverse sweep that nets a six, the cheeky cut. There was luck as well, of course, and that special growing sense that the day was a day for an extravaganza. Above all it was a huge cheer-up, a shot in the arm in the midst of national dejection and disarray. With the summer nearly over and the prospect of Halloween bringing not merely the usual collection of ghouls and sugar-crazed chancers, but a seismic shift in the country’s global fortunes, we should allow ourselves, just for a day, to indulge in a bit of patriotic delight. Within the boundaries of decorum, naturally. The point about sport is that it happens over and over again, which is both terrible – can’t we just freeze-frame Stokes’s final air punch and forget the rest? – and brilliant, because redemption is always possible as long as the ball’s in play. We lose ourselves in it because it’s not, contrary to Bill Shankly’s famous dictum, even more important than life and death itself. Rather, it is a temporary cessation of the world’s hostilities, an opportunity for a collective shrugging off of responsibility and burden. The losses and the humiliations are terrible, but they are not insurmountable. The victories, though: well, when they’re as sweet as this one, they deserve to be savoured for as long as possible. The Old Trafford Test is not, sadly, far away, and of course we may all be weeping into our beer within a fortnight. But not today. • Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 11.24 BST Covering the Greek crisis for BBC Newsnight in 2015 meant spending long days in a very hot Athens, eating too much room-service kebab and trying to stay on top of a series of twists and turns in Greek and European politics while all the time keeping an eye on the financial markets. The fundamental question was: will Greece do a deal or will it crash out of the euro? At the time, I had no idea that my crash course in European standoffs would prove useful to understanding what has emerged as the key question in British politics, Brexit: deal or no deal. On the first day of the Boris Johnson government, the emergence of former Vote Leave strategist Dominic Cummings in the role of senior adviser in Downing Street was taken to be more significant than any cabinet-level appointment. There’s a long tradition of talking up backroom operators in British politics, from Alastair Campbell in the 1990s to Nick Timothy under Theresa May, but, to me, the most striking parallel is with Greece. Although I imagine neither man would welcome the comparison, Cummings now seems to be playing the role of Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister in 2015. Cummings’s hardline approach to negotiations with Europe echoes that of Varoufakis. Like his counterpart in 2015, Cummings is in favour of pressing ahead with no-deal planning in order to secure a deal. And perhaps like Varoufakis in 2015, Cummings’s interests are not fundamentally aligned with those of the prime minister he serves. The point may come when Cummings has to be ditched. Both men are outsider insiders with no deep attachment to the party they work for. Varoufakis spent his working life in economics before being appointed finance minister, while Cummings has never been a member of the Conservative party. Most importantly, both have a sense of mission that is bigger than any individual prime minister, government or party. For Varoufakis, ending austerity in Greece was the goal, and he was prepared to risk slipping out of the euro to achieve it. For Cummings, exiting the European Union has been something he has spent the best part of 25 years trying to achieve. During his five-and-a-half-month stint as finance minister, Varoufakis’s strategy was premised around preparing Greece for a euro exit in order to win concessions from its creditors. The theory, and Varoufakis is a game theorist by background, was that a so-called Grexit would raise fundamental questions about the long-term future of the single currency. Once one member state had found the exit door, markets would begin to ask who was next, and the government debt of the rest of the “European periphery” would begin to fall in value. The very threat of leaving, he hoped, would force Greece’s lenders to relax the terms of their loans. That strategy failed for two reasons – first, the markets decided that 2015 was not another systemic euro crisis but rather an idiosyncratic “Greek crisis”. No matter how close Greece wandered to the cliff edge, it did not look like Portugal, Spain or Italy would follow. So rather than threatening mutually assured economic destruction, Varoufakis looked to be threatening just a Greek implosion. But domestic politics in Greece mattered just as much. When push came to shove, The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was not prepared to back his high-profile consigliere. He had been happy to allow him to front up the high-risk strategy until the last moment, but when it became clear that threatening the Greek equivalent of a no-deal Brexit had not won concessions Varoufakis was dropped like a stone. For the moment, Johnson’s and Cummings’s interests are aligned. Ramping up no-deal preparations while making clear that a “clean Brexit” is a workable option both helps contain the Brexit party vote share domestically and might help wrangle some minor changes out of Europe. But those interests could diverge very rapidly. Faced with at best a sharp economic slowdown and at worst serious fuel shortages in November, Johnson’s threat of a no-deal Brexit may appear to be as firm as Tsipras’s threat of a Greek euro exit in 2015. In which case Cummings would quickly go the way of Varoufakis. • Duncan Weldon is an economist, writer and broadcaster"

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/europe-abortion-laws-germany,"Contact author Wed 24 Jul 2019 06.00 BST When I was 30, in 2011, I had an abortion. I was living in Berlin, a city known, since the fall of the Wall, for championing freedom. Or at least it was until attention turned to my womb. Born in France in the 1980s, and brought up on the internet, the Erasmus European studies programme and love without borders, I was under the happy illusion that everything relating to women’s bodies – from abortion to assisted reproduction – was covered by rights secured after long, hard struggles. I blithely assumed that the milestones on the road to liberating French women – the May 1968 uprising, the 1971 “Manifesto of the 343” signed by women admitting to having had an abortion, Simone Veil, the health minister who legalised abortion, and the first test-tube babies – were all sufficiently European to be taken for granted, whatever the language. I was stunned to discover that ever since the Third Reich, Germany has been very concerned about the fate of its foetuses. Abortions, strictly speaking, are still not legal. Under paragraph 219a of the penal code, abortion is no longer a criminal offence, but gynaecologists who publish details of their methods may be prosecuted. German courts treat any form of information on abortion as “illegal publicity”. Fortunately no one assaulted me with knitting needles, nor was I thrown into prison. But I was subjected to a bureaucratic obstacle course. I was quizzed by medics and social workers, then made to wait for a long time; I was issued with an official permit, which was duly rubber-stamped, and then made to wait again. Finally, I was given the details of a “certified” doctor. The experience led to my rebirth as a feminist. Somewhere along the way I began to wonder how – in the 21st century and after more than 60 years of European integration – legislation on women’s bodies could be so different from one European Union member state to the next. As a journalist I’d focused my work for many years on women, from Warsaw to Nicosia, and their desire (or not) to have children. Having a remarkable range of choices and almost complete freedom seemed emblematic of women of my generation. I had observed eastern Europe’s absurd patchwork of reproductive rights and the geographical manoeuvres it entailed. I’d talked to women in Poland who had travelled to Germany to abort, Germans over 40 going to Greece for one last try at in vitro fertilisation, down-at-heel Ukrainians acting as surrogate mothers for same-sex couples in the west, and Czech donors selling their egg cells to their less fertile sisters in France. I had investigated abortion tourism, IVF trips and huge legal discrepancies, rooted in religious, moral or family values. Poland, for instance, has a ban on abortion, but is much the most liberal country for assisted reproductive technology: in the field of frozen embryo implants almost anything is possible, with state funding to boot. In what is supposedly a union, I saw women subjected to frontiers, national restrictions, and blame-laden or increasingly retrograde language. Did the passport-free Schengen area not apply to our wombs? Despite having built a single market, a single currency, shared institutions and a common capital, Europe offered no universal rule for women’s bodies. Friends in Paris travelled to Brussels to have their eggs frozen. Others, single or gay, had to make several trips to Spain. One woman I know had to have an abortion in the Netherlands because she was over the 12-week German limit. Surely for gender equality to have any real meaning it must start with that? It has often crossed my mind that if men had to abort, special drive-thru clinics and morning-after-pill vending machines would have sprung up all over our cities. There would be legal provision for all comers, no one forced to undergo abortion at sea in order to escape national restrictions, no court battles. It would all be above-board and freely accessible, with the benefit of EU-wide health insurance. How can the EU’s 28 member states agree on edible snails or shower heads, yet remain silent on the reproductive rights of half the population of the continent? Every year Europe issues hundreds of directives and legislative packages, but I’ve never heard of any plans to harmonise EU legislation on abortion. Now that I have a little girl I dream of European integration advancing in leaps and bounds, rather than stumbling. I wish the EU would take risks and be a pioneer for women’s rights. I refuse to applaud the fact that the gender pay gap is “only” 16.2%, that parental leave for both parents has been extended by 10 days, that violence against women has been outlawed. Much more is needed. Only societies that enjoy greater freedom can make up for increasingly tame political ideals, for a stagnant economy and for a historical miracle (the EU) in danger of turning out to be a mirage. If nation states can pool their currency or borders, then surely reproductive rights should be child’s play. It’s time to deliver a women’s Europe, even if it requires forceps.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/norway-independent-woman-afghanistan,"After leaving Afghanistan I was unprepared for life in a country where tasks are not strictly divided between the sexes Wed 24 Jul 2019 06.00 BST My life story might be summed up like this: I’ve travelled from one of the worst countries in the world for women to one of the best countries. I am an Afghan refugee in Norway. Adaptation is a process, and comparing these two countries would be totally unfair but I would like to share my insights into what it feels like to be an independent woman in both countries. As I write, I find myself on the shores of the Skagerrak strait in southern Norway. I’m on a typical cabin holiday, sitting by the water and feeling the fresh breeze playing with my curly, crazy hair at six in the morning. If I were in Afghanistan, this could only be a dream – not just because Afghanistan is landlocked, but because it is not safe enough for a woman to feel the 6am breeze by herself without the company of a man. In 2014, I was a student at Kabul university and employed part-time. I decided to refresh my English, so I enrolled in a 6am class at a nearby coaching centre. A taxi driver would drop me off at the classes, but one day in December he apologised to me, saying that he couldn’t defrost his taxi that early in the morning, so I decided to go by myself. A week later a man attacked me in the street – it felt like he was going to kidnap me, but his aim was only to harass. I ran after him, and he was eventually caught by private security guards who were working at a nearby house. In Afghan culture, disrespecting a woman is not acceptable. After that, I had to abandon my class – without getting the diploma. I come from a liberal and educated family in Afghanistan. Nothing was more important for them than my becoming an independent woman. This was especially the case for my mother, who was also educated and independent. I believed that I was independent enough until I landed in Norway. In Afghanistan, a women being independent means she can educate herself well enough to be able to work and pay her own bills. She takes care of so-called female household tasks and children, as well as working outside the home. I was trained to be an independent woman in Afghanistan, but it turns out that independence in Norway means something utterly different. After I got my residence permit, I was taken to an empty room in Oslo. I had hardly ever shopped for furniture before, and I did not even know how to measure up for curtains or how to use a drill. In Afghanistan, all the heavy jobs were supposedly men’s tasks: from gardening, grocery and furniture shopping to fixing things, technical matters and painting. In addition, men had to provide for their entire family, as most women in employment– including me – were hardly willing to split household expenses equally with the man of the household. After a while, I found out that there is no gender for household tasks in Norway. I met Norwegian women who had built their own cabins or parts of houses. They could paint, do carpentry, cut grass and still carry out the main responsibilities of raising a child – and they split the household expenses with their partners. And of course, most Norwegian men can cook and parent a child, too. In Norway, an independent woman is self-governing in all matters. I’m adapting to that new meaning of independence, and it feels much better to live this way. We should teach the younger generation that the road to genuine independence depends on learning that women can do whatever men do. • Hasina Shirzad is an Afghan refugee and a university student in Norway"

Last modified on Wed 24 Jul 2019 10.21 BST I have never been an exile in the strict sense of the word. I left Turkey voluntarily – mostly for professional reasons – in 2011, long before the crackdown on academics began. The country was still being described as “partly free” by the Freedom House Democracy Index, though the early signs of the regime’s authoritarian slide were already clearly evident. The rest is history. Or a suspenseful horror flick with many twists. While I was enjoying the peace of a Swedish university town where the front page of the bestselling regional newspaper Sydsvenskan reported the “tragic story” of an undergraduate student who filed a police complaint about a local hairdresser who over-trimmed her split ends, Turkey was rocked by country-wide protest movements, an increasing police clampdown, mass purges and a failed coup, all topped off by half a dozen elections and a change of regime from a parliamentary to a (super-)presidential system. I thus joined the ranks of the newly founded “WhatsApp diaspora”, a small, yet growing group of Turkish citizens in various countries who were communicating with each other through presumably secure encrypted applications and expressing their discontent by retweeting the hashtag du jour. When at some point during Istanbul’s Gezi Park protests in 2013 I managed to attract the wrath of the ruling AKP party’s troll army through my social media activism, I even received death threats – so for three months I went around with a special alarm, a little keyring-like red button that I had to hide from my then three-year-old son. All these years spent outside Turkey have taught me two things. First, the meaning of being in exile. I still wouldn’t describe myself as an exile, for this would be adding insult to the injury of hundreds of thousands of others who have had to flee their homes, often leaving their loved ones behind, simply to avoid spending the rest of their lives behind bars. I was among the lucky ones. The threats to my life stopped overnight when the news spread that my son was terminally ill. I could go in and out of Turkey to visit my family as I wasn’t part of the “Academics for Peace” group – the name given to more than 2,000 signatories of a petition that demanded a peaceful resolution to the decades-long conflict between the state and Kurdish PKK militants. And my activism on behalf of my colleagues, friends and other victims of our autocracy didn’t cause me much trouble. But I now knew how it felt to be in exile. Not only vicariously, through the experiences of acquaintances who were stripped of their basic rights and freedoms, but also through my own sense of loss and nostalgia. Turkey was not my home any more. It had morphed into what was emphatically called the “New Turkey”, under quasi-fascist one-man rule. Finally, I could grasp the deeper meaning of a line in James Baldwin’s novel Giovanni’s Room: “You don’t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you never can go back.” Perhaps more importantly, looking at things from a distance has enabled me to formulate my own theory of democracy in Turkey. Democracy in Turkey is like dew. I wasn’t aware, until I’d done some research, that dew forms mostly on clear nights when exposed surfaces lose heat to the sky by radiation. Then these surfaces cool the surrounding air, and with sufficient humidity, the temperature falls below the “dew point”, with vapour condensing out of the air on to the surfaces. This is pretty much the story of Turkey’s experiments with democracy. A lot of factors need to converge for even a semblance of democracy to occur: clear nights, the right temperature, sufficient humidity. When it all comes together, we have a relatively free political environment like little oases of water droplets. If we are lucky enough, droplets proliferate, merge and become resilient. Perhaps the Gezi Park protest was such a moment. Or the first term of the AKP, when the party needed the support of various segments of society and the European Union to survive the military juggernaut. Unfortunately, it takes a lot for democracy to materialise, but not much for it to be dispersed. A simple blow, either by the military or an elected strongman such as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is enough to break up the painstakingly formed droplets. And democracy evaporates. I see the recent victory of the opposition candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu in the rerun of Istanbul’s municipal election as such a moment. The night was clear: the military neutralised, the PKK defeated and the Gülenists accused of being behind the 2016 coup attempt banished. The temperature was right: the economy was not doing well and the crisis with the US over Russian S-400 missiles was simmering. And propitious humidity levels were reached when the opposition formed a coalition indirectly involving the Kurds and managed to nominate a charismatic, unifying figure to run against the AKP’s tedious candidate. The political surface was fully exposed to air when Erdoğan ordered a rerun of the elections. On the morning of 25 June, the whole of Turkey was covered with dew. The challenge ahead is huge. It is not too difficult for Erdoğan to shake things up and get rid of the droplets before they merge into a pond. And after all, politics is not thermodynamics. Rules can be bent or altered. If we want the water droplets to stabilise and spread, we must protect them. If we want to have our home back – “those things, those places, those people which [we] would always, helplessly, and in whatever bitterness of spirit, love above all else”, as Baldwin wrote – we must reclaim it. • Umut Özkırımlı is a political scientist based at Lund University, Sweden, and the author of Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction"

Last modified on Thu 15 Aug 2019 07.16 BST As Dutch elm disease spread across Britain in the 1970s, the country fell into mourning. When the sentinel trees that framed our horizons were felled, their loss was a constant topic of sad and angry conversation. Today, just a few years into the equally devastating ash dieback epidemic, and as the first great trees are toppled, most of us appear to have forgotten all about it. I’ve travelled around much of Britain this summer, and seen the disease almost everywhere. A survey published this spring found infected trees across roughly three-quarters of England and Wales: the spread has been as rapid and devastating as ecologists predicted. But in this age of hypernormalisation, only a few people still seem to care. Ash to ashes: our memories wither as quickly as the trees. And almost nothing has been learned. Our disease prevention rules, whose scope is restricted by the European Union and the World Trade Organization, and whose enforcement is restricted by the British government’s austerity, do little to prevent similar plagues afflicting our remaining trees. Several deadly pathogens are marching across Europe. While it is hard to prevent some of these plagues from spreading across land, there is a simple measure that would stop most of them from spreading across water: a ban on the import of all live plants except those grown from tissue cultures, in sterile conditions. But bans are more or less banned. Nothing must be allowed to obstruct free trade. Instead, the world’s governments rely on hand wringing. Take, for example, a lethal plague called Xylella fastidiosa, which is ravaging olive groves in Italy and threatens a remarkable variety of trees and shrubs, including oak, sycamore, plane and cherry. The system for preventing its spread depends on inspections of random consignments of known host plants, and a passport scheme to ensure they aren’t imported from infected areas. This system is likely to be useless. The EU keeps a list of plants that can carry Xylella. It has been updated 12 times in four years, as new carriers emerge. No one knows how many more host species there might be. Visual inspections won’t reveal plants that carry the disease without symptoms. Random sampling won’t protect us from a plague that can be introduced by a single plant. Nor do we know whether Xylella is the most urgent risk to our remaining trees, or whether an entirely new contagion will hit them instead. Many plant pathogens evolve at extraordinary speed, jump unexpectedly from one host to another, suddenly hybridise with each other, and behave in radically different ways in different environments. A system that regulates only known risks is bound to fail. Even in economic terms, the live plant trade is senseless. Ash dieback alone, according to a paper in Current Biology, will cost this country around £15bn. But the UK’s import and export of all live plants amounts to £300m a year – 2% of the costs of this disease. The paper estimates that another 47 major tree pests and diseases now threaten to arrive in Britain, and these are just the known plagues. In ecological terms, this legislative failure is a total disaster. For the sake of deregulatory machismo, we face the prospect of tree species everywhere eventually meeting their deadly pathogens. Where logging and climate breakdown have so far failed to eliminate the world’s forests, imported diseases threaten to complete the job. What will come next? Will our beech trees succumb to Phytophthora kernoviae, a disease that appears to have been imported to Cornwall on infected shrubs from New Zealand? Will Sitka spruce, on which commercial forestry in this country relies to an extraordinary extent, be hammered by the larger eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, found for the first time this year in a Kent woodland? Will it be hit by another marvellously named plague, Neonectria fuckeliana? Or by something else entirely? As the trade in live plants reaches almost every corner of the Earth, nothing and nowhere is safe. Just as we need a precautionary approach, every lid is being ripped off, every barrier smashed, facilitating trade in everything, including pathogens. In response to a parliamentary question about Xylella, the environment minister, Thérèse Coffey, claimed that Brexit creates an opportunity to introduce “stricter biosecurity measures”. It does, but will it be used? Given that, for the monomaniacs who now run this country, the main purpose of leaving the EU is to escape its public protections, the chances of Brexit leading to stricter regulation of plant imports seem remote. Never mind that this trade makes neither ecological nor economic sense. Our government, like many others, favours a global trade regime that places the free movement of goods above all other values (while imposing ever tighter restrictions on the free movement of people). There’s nothing good about ash dieback, but there is one useful thing that could be done: wherever possible, leave the dead trees to stand. There is more life in a dead tree than in a living tree: around 2,000 animal species in the UK rely on dead or dying wood for their survival. But (except in politics) there’s a dearth of dead wood in this country. Many species, such as the lesser spotted woodpecker, the pied flycatcher and the stag beetle, are severely restricted by the shortage of decay, caused by our tidy-minded forestry. And there’s another reason to let the dead giants stand: as memorials to the repeated failures of government. Let us remember our losses, and learn from them. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Wed 24 Jul 2019 09.21 BST What will Boris Johnson do now? Deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn, he said today in his victory speech. But how? Some of his most important decisions will be made very shortly – and they will involve who he puts in his cabinet. Johnson is not a details man, or a man who delivers on his promises, or a man with a particularly strong or comprehensive vision for the future. His ministers will decide the country’s next direction. His top team, then, will have to be competent, and their philosophy, when it comes to policy, will matter too. Then there is the question of balance. Johnson’s verbal obfuscations have steered him through the narrow path between one nation Tories and the hardline Brexiteers. A byelection next week is expected to cut Johnson’s working majority to just two. He will need to keep everyone on side, which means his cabinet will have to represent them. What of policy? Johnson should ignore any calls to come up with immediate policy programmes that look beyond Brexit: that is missing the point. Under his plans the country risks a disastrous no deal in October – the consequences of which will affect all domestic policy and kill any plans a prime minister had for it. Instead Johnson should prioritise preparing for no deal – we have a lot to do here if we wish to catch up with our European counterparts. This will likely mean bringing forward some new legislation, and preparing an emergency no-deal budget. Johnson used to cite the mayor in Jaws as his hero – but before he draws up full policies on beachcombing and paddleboarding he’ll need to deal with the shark. • Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent. The rise of Boris Johnson was only really ever improbable if you were under the delusion that we live in a meritocracy. We don’t. This is the class system in action – propelling confident, incompetent, posh white men to the top regardless of their abilities, record or character. That is the system that produced and sustained him, and that is the system in whose interests he will govern. His ascent is, of course, a catastrophe for the country. Whether he’s sucking up to Donald Trump, lying about kippers or insulting allies and enemies alike, he is a liability. That the Conservative parliamentary party is in effect at one with the membership on his premiership signals how deep the rot has set in. Where the Tories are concerned, this is not a putsch or a coup – it’s a wholesale makeover and takeover. They have nowhere else to go. And if they go down they’re determined to take the rest of us with them. There is nothing to celebrate in this moment but the symmetry. The leave campaign had no more plans for leaving the European Union than a dog chasing a car has to drive it. Now its most prominent spokesman is in charge of making it happen. For the past three years they have been able to claim that only if a true believer were in charge everything would be different. With Johnson in charge they are running out of people to blame for the situation they created. That, of course, will not stop them. But it does expose them. When Theresa May produced her agreement, Johnson said it was like polishing a turd. He was right. He just failed to acknowledge that it was his turd. Now he finds himself with an unfamiliar task for a man of his pedigree – to clean up after himself. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist Every new political leader wants to show how different they will be to their predecessor. For Boris Johnson, it will be very easy to presume that being cheerful and getting Britain out of the European Union on 31 October will be enough of a contrast from Theresa May. But he will need more than energy and a “can-do” spirit, as he put it today. Brexit will certainly occupy his first few months, but Johnson should also have learned from May’s failure to introduce the domestic reforms she claimed to care about the most. You cannot wait for quieter, easier times to work on these changes. For one thing, those times may never come, given Brexit is not going to be over and done with even if Britain does leave in October. And for another, Johnson, like May, cannot assume that he is going to have all the time in the world at his disposal. Towards the end of his leadership campaign, Johnson demanded cross-party talks to find a solution to the social care crisis. He not only needs to set these up immediately but also lock all the parties in to the policy they eventually develop so that there is not a repeat of previous collapses in talks. He is also about to appoint a new housing secretary, and must choose someone experienced with an ability to deliver tough reforms. He has been worryingly quiet on his support for the domestic abuse bill, which May introduced at the very last minute in an attempt to save it from being forgotten. His excuse may have been that he didn’t want to be presumptuous about domestic policy when he hadn’t yet been elected. Now he’s in place, he cannot be presumptuous that he will have time later on to do the things he thinks are important to change Britain. • Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator and presenter of Radio 4’s Week in Westminster Now that Boris Johnson has fulfilled his lifelong ambition, the risk is not that he will pursue a no-deal Brexit, but that he has lashed himself so tightly to the European Research Group (ERG) fanatics that they will carry him, and all of us, over the cliff edge just to feel the wind in their hair on the way down. Can Johnson rescue Britain from the Brexit bind or will Tory members and MPs rue the day they elevated him? Johnson claimed not to be daunted by the task ahead today. But the scale of it is enormous. Just like Theresa May before him, Johnson has talked up the “threat” of no deal. Yet threatening a colossal act of self-harm is an obvious and self-defeating bluff. Besides, no deal is a process, not a destination: it is plainly unsustainable for the UK to have no agreement covering half its international trade or more than a million of its citizens. Nonetheless, it appears more credible from a man with a history of personal, political and professional recklessness than from a leader who, despite her many flaws, appeared to consider every aspect of life as more a matter of duty than pleasure. So the UK can either negotiate a deal while still inside the bloc or from a weaker position outside of it. No matter what, there will be an eternal return to the question of the Irish border. Even if the UK were to exit without a deal, agreeing to the backstop and paying the financial settlement will be preconditions of any trade talks. Johnson knows this, and knows that conceding to those conditions after the chaos of a disorderly no-deal Brexit would be a humiliation from which he could never recover. That’s why it is more likely that Johnson will seek to scrap the withdrawal agreement for a prolonged transition where Britain exits the political union but remains in everything else. During that time, the ERG cabinet he is likely to appoint will be tasked with negotiating a new free trade agreement. But buried beneath it all will surely be either the backstop reimagined or an indefinite continuation of the transition period, with no unilateral exit. That will be a price that many in the ERG will not be prepared to pay – and they may yet have the chance to live out their fantasies of a running jump over the edge. • Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice. He writes in a personal capacity Boris Johnson will have no time to savour his victory. During the campaign Johnson sent mixed signals when he pledged to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal on 31 October – while also saying he wanted a deal. The only way to actually achieve a deal is to actively engage with the EU27, who are far less enthralled with Johnson than the Conservative party membership. As prime minister, he will begin by a series of visits to European capitals where he will be politely received, but it’s important that he does not mistake civility for support. From the outset, the EU has said what it meant in these negotiations – and meant what it said. There is little appetite in Europe to offer Johnson concessions that were not afforded to Theresa May. Bonhomie and bluster will count for little. What will Boris Johnson ask for? If he seeks a standstill transition period during which the future relationship is negotiated, he will be refused. The EU will not abandon the backstop or the wider withdrawal agreement: it will be possible, though, to revisit a Northern Ireland-only backstop – the original design – or to achieve changes to the political declaration that specify in greater detail how the backstop provisions would fall away once credible alternatives became available. Around Europe, they will take note of who is given the Brexit portfolio in a Johnson government. If it is a Brexit ultra, the EU will ratchet up preparations for no deal. • Brigid Laffan is director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, and director of the global governance programme, both at the European University Institute, Florence"

Last modified on Tue 20 Aug 2019 14.36 BST It started with a tweet. I wondered why people like the Edinburgh fringe so much, when it sounds like my idea of hell: loads of “theatre” (with capital-letter ACTING); audience interaction; comedians; circus-type things. Edinburgh itself is gorgeous, so am I just a misery guts? That is a rhetorical question, obviously. The answers came thick and fast. I would love the fringe, apparently, if only I got taken to the right shows. Then I could go to 10 in one day! But I know myself. One artwork a day is quite enough, ta. Then, of course, came the inevitable low blow. I was told my attitude is a sign of ageing, because I don’t want to trek up to Scotland, where the best joke this year, apparently, is a zinger about cauliflower florets. Jesus. I want my money back and I didn’t even go. Fittingly, a new report, Ageist Britain, tells us the bleedin’ obvious: that society is ageist and life after 50 is assumed to be awful, as we are all bitter hags or old farts. Or, in my case, both. A lot of rubbish is talked about getting older. Nora Ephron is the go-to person for women with crepey necks. Me? I prefer Ursula K Le Guin: “I am not ‘in’ this body. I am this body. Waist or no waist.” That is a life lesson I would like every girl to learn. Le Guin also said: “Erase my age, you erase my life – me.” But Google the signs of ageing and the results will be about skincare, diet and exercise. Fundamentally and depressingly, not the actual point. Some of us will die of diseases that are genetic. Some will look better than we did when we were young. Most of us do just fine. Wear a bikini. Don’t wear a bikini. Really, I do think there are bigger things to think about (and I don’t mean a forgiving one-piece). If you want Carol Vorderman’s arse and Lana Del Rey’s lips and Kim Kardashian’s waist, I can’t help you. If you think a knee lift will change your life, well, good luck. If you think you can stay for ever young, I have some breaking news. But no one talks about the good bits of ageing, so I will. The menopause. A time of anxiety and then freedom, when women move from being someone who can reproduce to someone who can’t. Everything changes physically and mentally. It is a premonition of death and one becomes a different kind of being altogether: a creature who can only reproduce itself. Ageing is also a process of editing. You know those people you didn’t like much? Well, don’t bother with them. If someone has said “we must do lunch” for 20 years and you haven’t, you are not going to now, just as you are not going to wear that little black dress you were wearing when you got off with X. There is no need to go the full Marie Kondo, but you are old enough to know what does not spark joy. Do you want to go to a restaurant where every ingredient has been cooked five clever ways? No. Do you want to sit in bars where the music is so loud that everyone is shouting? No again. Do you still want to go and see loud music? For sure. My God, the Necks was the most fabulous gig I have been to this year. As for parties, well, as Iman said wisely when David Bowie was wooing her: “He has been to all the parties there are.” Nothing makes you feel older than drinking cheap white wine and making small talk with people who ask you about schools and property. Trust me. Getting old means relief at being cancelled – not in the social media sense, but in the “let’s not bother meeting for lunch” sense. It means loving new things and discarding old things. It means living as you want to live, not as you should. Apart from chronic disease, of course, the worst thing about ageing is having to wear stupid glasses. But there is the wonder, too, as that Blur song says, of the way the days “seem to fall through you / Well, just let them go.” Time is for wasting. Time is what you make of it. You choose. The best sign of ageing, though, is that you are still you – only more so. •Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Thu 22 Aug 2019 19.49 BST An influential conservative thinktank – fronted by the former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith – has proposed the state pension age should rise to 75 over the next 16 years. If the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) had its way, the retirement age would go up to 70 just nine years from now, as the change is phased in. It’s important to stress that it’s not yet government policy, but given the CSJ’s influence, it’s not unreasonable to imagine a future with dramatically delayed retirement. It’s a demographic reality that the state is having to meet higher pension costs: the pensions bill rose from £17bn in 1989 to £92bn today, and will cost £20bn more by 2023 as the population ages. The government already plans to increase the pension age to 67 in 2028 and then 68 by 2046, leaving us working well into our twilight years. At the same time, nearly 4 million women have already been forced to wait up to an extra six years to get their pensions after changes to bring women’s retirement age into line with men’s. Three-quarters of the UK’s elderly will rely entirely on their state payments by 2036 The CSJ’s idea of raising the pension age further received glowing coverage in sections of the rightwing press, with the Telegraph marvelling how it would “boost the economy” by £182bn and stave off the “escalating cost” of state pensions. As Duncan Smith tweeted this week: “Removing barriers for older people to working longer has the potential to improve health and wellbeing, increase retirement savings and ensure the full functioning of public services for all.” It’s a dystopian vision of life, in which capitalism tells workers who have already grafted for 40 years that working a five-day week through their 70s is in fact the path to a healthy body and society. The “work pays” mantra endorsed by Duncan Smith for pensioners has already been adopted by the Department for Work and Pensions in relation to disabled people, where pushing the sick off out of work benefits and into the labour market has long been framed as a blessing. Such policy is obtusely class blind. How long we live – and therefore how much time we have to enjoy retirement – varies across region and economic bracket. In Glasgow, boys born between 2015 and 2017 have a life expectancy of just 73.3 years – meaning under this plan, many would never reach pensionable age. Whether it’s even physically possible to do our job in old age varies along class lines; it’s a considerably different experience to be a labourer at 75 than a lecturer. Health inequality is also a stark factor; a woman living in the most deprived 10% of England, for example, has a life expectancy of 78.7 years, but only 52 of those years are in good health. Any rise in the pensionable age would force the poorest to work through years of illness and disability, while only the wealthy have the luxury to retire in good health. The pressing issue is not that pensions are too generous – but that they are increasingly hard to get, and far too small. British basic pensions are uniquely low – 16% of average earnings – compared with those of other developed nations, and require a long contribution period (often penalising women who take time off for caring responsibilities). The existing system leaves many older people struggling to get by; research this week shows the proportion of elderly people living in severe poverty in the UK is five times what it was in 1986, the largest increase among western European countries. The safety net of the state pension is even more crucial in an era in which private pensions are increasingly out of reach. The rise in gig-economy working, as well as a squeeze on wages, means workplace pensions are unaffordable or nonexistent for many. It means three-quarters of the UK’s elderly will rely entirely on their state payments by 2036. So in the coming years, it’s going to be increasingly important to defend the principle of the state pension: that welfare is not a waste or a drain, but a civilised safety net that exists for the good of society, which we are all entitled to. Similarly, we must challenge the worldview in which our only value is as workers; as if time with our grandchildren is less meaningful than more contribution to the GDP. There needs to be a genuine conversation about how to fund an ageing population, from pensions to social care, but any agenda to push the burden away from the state and further on to the individual is a dangerous one. Working lives should be shorter, and the reward for a life of effort bigger. “Work till you drop” is no way to live. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People"

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 13.47 BST Ten days before David Cameron’s disastrous Brexit referendum in 2016, a group of EU diplomats asked me for my prediction. Ignore the narrative that remain would sweep to inevitable victory, I told them: Britain is heading directly for the exit. Perturbed – this was not what other journalists were telling them – they explained what would happen if so. There would never be a favourable deal for Britain. This was an existential question for the EU: they could not incentivise other nations to leave. Their electorates already resented special treatment for Britain, from the rebate to its exemption from Schengen. They had their own domestic anti-EU and anti-immigration political forces to contend with, none of which they wished to encourage. And if their countries suffered any economic damage because of Brexit, then their voters would be even more resentful towards Britain and even less willing to offer concessions. Strikingly, there were no dissenters from this united position. These basic political facts should have underpinned all British coverage of over three years of Brexit debacle. Instead, with honourable exceptions, we have been fed a daily diet of delusion and fantasy: that if only Rule Britannia was screamed with sufficient gusto and with enough decibels, 27 united foreign governments would somehow be faced down. Take the reported claims that Angela Merkel had offered a 30-day timetable to renegotiate: in fact, she simply declared, “we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come.” Nothing meaningful is going to be offered or conceded by the EU: it is simply not going to happen, and yet every day several media outlets peddle the deceit that it will. Both the Tories and much of the media are in the grip of a deluded group with ravenous appetites: the more red meat they’ve been thrown – by David Cameron, then Theresa May, now Boris Johnson – the fatter and hungrier they’ve got. Each day brings another example of their delusions colliding with reality, yet they only become more fanatical. During the referendum, they told us German car manufacturers would force Merkel to offer Britain a favourable deal. It’s now been revealed that German food producers might not bother exporting food to us after a disorderly exit from the EU because of bottlenecks at ports. The truth is, nothing will ever satisfy these fantasists. Even if the EU scrubbed away the backstop – an impossibility – hardcore Brexiteers are already making it clear that wouldn’t be enough. From the very start of this process there has been a failure to report it properly. There has been no acknowledgement that the EU collectively lacks any incentive to offer meaningful concessions based on the Tories’ red lines. Nor that, even if they did, those who have captured the Conservatives’ commanding heights would refuse them. For the next few weeks, a pantomime beckons, with Tory papers breathlessly claiming that Johnson’s British Bulldog resolve compared to May’s timidity has the EU on the back foot, or preparing to surrender, or about to offer sweeping new concessions. It’s all noise. European governments simply want to ensure that the British government squarely takes the blame for what is to pass. Although the EU is far more prepared for no deal, when their member states do indeed suffer an economic shock, their aggrieved voters will not countenance offering Britain meaningful concessions when it is forced, enfeebled, back to the negotiating table. What will the insatiable Brexit fantasists say then? • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/23/in-praise-of-address-unknown-the-anti-nazi-novel-that-saw-into-the-future,"First published in 1938, US author Kathrine Kressmann Taylor’s forgotten classic is a devastating work of political fiction that still resonates today Jonathan Freedland Fri 23 Aug 2019 08.00 BST Some of the largest themes have been addressed in the shortest books. That is especially true in the realm of what might be called political fiction. The single best evocation of communism – and especially the distance between the ideal and the Soviet reality – remains George Orwell’s brief allegory, Animal Farm. In the same way, few works have conveyed the brutal nature of imperialism more effectively than Joseph Conrad managed in fewer than a hundred pages in Heart of Darkness. A third place in that small space on the shelf could be allocated to an even briefer work: Address Unknown, a story so short it can be read on a morning bus ride. Yet somehow it distils the essence of the ideology that, along with the other two, casts a deathly shadow over the 20th century. Across a few economic pages it touches the heart of the Nazi darkness. Address Unknown was first published in Story magazine in September 1938, and then in book form a year later, becoming an instant bestseller. It has been translated across the world, adapted into a 1944 film and into multiple productions for the stage and radio – all under the name of Kressmann Taylor, after Story’s editor, along with Kathrine Kressmann Taylor’s husband, Elliott, decided it was “too strong to appear under the name of a woman”. The impact was immediate, the story credited with having “jolted America”, alerting it to the horror unfolding in Nazi Germany. It consists of nothing more than an intermittent correspondence between two friends. Yet the epistolary form is deceptively efficient, supplying backstory, plot, character, dialogue and more than one narrative voice before a conventional novel might have cleared its throat. Within a page or two, we are in the world of Martin and Max, both German, the latter a Jew now living in San Francisco, the former now back in Munich – two men who have been business partners, friends and whose families have, as we shall discover, been intimately connected. Their exchange, spanning just 16 months between 1932 and 1934, illuminates not just the specific texture of the early Nazi period, but something more timeless. It serves as a guide to the way any politics of identity – especially one that invokes “the people”, rooting that idea in blood and soil – eventually, and often very rapidly, divides and polarises. Max and Martin have shared “the fireside”, there finding “warmth and understanding, where small selfishnesses are impossible and where wine and books and talk give a different meaning to existence”. But even the very best of friends can be rent apart. Once a dividing line is drawn, it’s astonishing how swiftly people can break from those who stand on the other side of it. In that sense, Address Unknown is a warning. We tell ourselves, as these characters do, that friendship is eternal, that some bonds will never be broken. This short story warns us that ideology, once it has turned to fever, is stronger than friendship. The story traces the contours of fascism – the leader-worship, the surveillance, the summons to men to act as men That’s because any total, all-consuming creed will first separate “us” from “them”, and then separate “them” from the rest of the human family. Dehumanisation has been the overture to every genocidal opera (though it’s worth stressing that Taylor was writing in 1938, before the Nazis’ “final solution to the Jewish problem” was under way). It happened that way in Rwanda in the 1990s, when the pro-government radio station started telling Hutus to see the Tutsi minority not as people but as inyenzi, or cockroaches, and as inzoka, or snakes. And it happens in the correspondence that forms Address Unknown, as steadily Martin comes to see Max not as a friend, not even as Max but as a representative of “the Jews”. The antisemitism that comes out of Martin’s mouth – “The Jewish race is a sore spot to any nation that harbours it” – thus shocks not because we don’t expect a German in 1933 to be expressing anti-Jewish racism, but because it is expressed by one man towards another who used to be his friend. If that shift from seeing the individual, Max, to seeing only a collective, “the Jewish race”, resonates today, it might be because the political rhetoric of our time keeps making a similar move, one visible beyond the resurgence, on left and right, of antisemitism. On the United States border, to take just one example, there are not individual mothers and fathers and children trying to come to America, but rather – at least in the language of the current US president and his cable TV amplifiers – a “caravan”, an “invasion”. If there is a Texan Martin writing to a Mexican Max today, perhaps he too can no longer quite see his old friend as a person. Taylor is perceptive too about how racism sneaks up on the individual who lets it in. Martin tells Max it wasn’t that, in the past, he didn’t notice the fact that Max was a Jew, but rather that he made an exception for him. “I have never hated the individual Jew,” Martin writes. “Yourself I have always cherished as a friend, but … you will know that I speak in all honesty when I say that I have loved you, not because of your race but in spite of it.” The exempting of the occasional good Jew from a merited disdain for the Jewish people as a whole has long been a feature of antisemitism, and it’s a device that remains in use to this day. Nor are self-described liberals or progressives immune from the virus of bigotry. Max tells Martin he has faith in his old friend’s “liberal mind and warm heart”. And, sure enough, Martin is not seduced by Adolf Hitler immediately. “Is he quite sane?” he asks himself. “I do not know.” But it does not take too long for him to succumb. Soon he is adoring “the Gentle Leader”, ready to assent to whatever surgery might be required to cut out “the cancer” that ails the Fatherland. In this way, the story traces the universal contours of fascism – the leader-worship, the compulsory group-think, the surveillance, the summons to men to act as men – as well as the particular topography of the Nazi landscape. In Address Unknown, Jews are associated with art forms that Hitler would have despised – modern painting and theatre – as well as with commerce. On this point, Taylor shows good moral sense: she makes clear that, however much Nazi propaganda might have insisted otherwise, Aryan Germans were as implicated in buying and selling, profit and loss, as the Jews they loathed for those very activities. Max makes money selling art, but so does Martin. All of this is achieved with concision even as it leaves room for some memorable writing. “The old wound has healed, but the scar throbs at times, my friend,” writes Martin. Later, speaking of the change of mood in his country, he says: “The old despair has been thrown aside like a forgotten coat.” As if that were not enough, Address Unknown comes with a killer twist. That this short, fleeting story has lasted so long is not only because of its artistic achievement, and not only because, written in 1938, it astonishingly anticipated the horror that was yet to come. It is because its prescience is not confined to its time. It saw into our own future too. • Address Unknown by Kressmann Taylor is published by Serpent’s Tail (£7.99).

Last modified on Mon 22 Jul 2019 22.50 BST While we all obsess about Britain’s new Brexiteer Conservative government, don’t lose sight of this: under Jo Swinson, the new leader they have just elected by a clear majority, the Liberal Democrats have a chance of leading a fightback for liberal Britain. The great unrepresented liberal Britain, that is, that people around the world admire and miss. To achieve this, the Lib Dems must dramatically raise their game, reaching parts of a troubled country that they have not touched for a century. “The Strange Death of Liberal England” is one of the most memorable book titles in British political history, so I am tempted to conjure up The Strange Rebirth of Liberal England. But liberal England never died, and nor did liberal Scotland – whence Swinson comes – and liberal Wales. Indeed, the British Social Attitudes survey shows that, in attitudes to sexual orientation and ethnicity, British society has become more liberal in recent decades. Labour and Conservatives have leaders who are both unqualified to be PM and open to radically illiberal positions What nearly died was not liberal Britain, but the Liberal party. (That was the subject of George Dangerfield’s celebrated Strange Death.) Pull up the graph of the Liberals’ electoral performance over the last 100 years and you have the side-view of a fairground rollercoaster. Having been one of the major parties of government for six decades until the end of the first world war, it sunk to a small minority (in votes and, due to an unfair electoral system, even more in seats) between 1931 and the early 1970s. It then revived, strengthened by an alliance and eventual merger with the Social Democrats, who had broken away from the Labour party – hence the name change to Liberal Democrats – and in 2005 got 62 parliamentary seats, its best result since 1923. In 2010, with 57 MPs, it scored the apparent triumph of going into coalition government with the Conservatives, only to be punished for the sin of pragmatism by an electoral dressing-down to eight MPs in 2015, and just a few more after the 2017 snap election. Yet the rollercoaster ride was not over. The Liberals (to give them back their proper name) bravely came out for a second referendum the day after the 2016 Brexit referendum, and have ever since been the party of remain, while the Conservatives have made an almighty mess of Brexit and Labour has disastrously equivocated. As a result, they trounced both Labour and Conservatives in the recent European elections. They now have upwards of 106,000 mainly new members – a tally fast catching up with the at most 160,000 mainly elderly Conservative party members who have almost certainly chosen Boris Johnson to be their leader and hence Britain’s new prime minister. The Liberals have scored better than Labour in at least two recent polls of voting intentions for the general election that Britain will probably have sooner rather than later. Watch out, though. The Liberals are the party of false dawns. “We are going for a landslide,” said Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe in 1974. “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government,” cried David Steel in 1981. Their current success results from the unique conjuncture of two circumstances. First, the identity divide between remainers and leavers has become more important than any other political divide, and they are the remain party. Second, Labour and the Conservatives (assuming Johnson gets the laurel crown) have leaders who are both, in very different ways, unqualified to be prime minister and open to radically illiberal positions. Johnson is an irresponsible liar and narcissist, as disqualified by his character to be British prime minister as Donald Trump is to be US president. He has not ruled out suspending parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. In a parliamentary liberal democracy, what could be more illiberal? Jeremy Corbyn is a veteran, well-intentioned socialist campaigner, but woolly-weak and steered by profoundly illiberal advisers. No true liberal could have tolerated so much antisemitism in the party for so long. But if either of the big parties came back to the liberal centre – and, as a liberal who is independent of all parties, I hope they both will – then this unique opportunity would rapidly pass. In order to seize this chance, the Liberals must go both deeper and wider. Swinson had an attractively brief leadership manifesto with three points: building an economy that puts people and the planet first, harnessing the technological revolution and rallying “a liberal movement to stand up for our values and against the forces of populism and nationalism”. Now she needs to spell out what “our values” are. That means engaging more deeply with liberalism, starting with its core value of individual liberty. She should reach back to the magnificent British tradition of liberalism, from John Locke and “Freeborn John” Lilburne, through John Stuart Mill and William Ewart Gladstone, all the way to Isaiah Berlin and George Orwell. I’m not proposing an arcane seminar in political theory; all these great liberals spoke plainer, more vivid and muscular English than does any politician today. You can confront Johnson with Gladstone and Corbyn with Orwell. And then you can show how these liberal values speak to the new challenges of our time, such as climate change, gender equality (on which Swinson wrote a book), education and preserving the European Union as the world’s pioneering example of liberal international order. That depth will help with achieving a new breadth. It will strike chords with liberal Labour and Conservative voters who voted Liberal for the first time in the European elections, but might not in a general election. The Liberals are slated to win a byelection in Brecon next week. They now have Chuka Umunna, perhaps the most talented politician to leave Labour via the Change UK party, and should soon be joined by at least one of the three charismatic, pro-remain female MPs who left the Conservatives for Change UK. A few sitting Conservatives are reportedly contemplating defection to the Liberals. But even then, the parliamentary party will be a tiny band. In a general election, they will need what Swinson calls “bespoke” electoral understandings with Greens, Plaid Cymru, liberal Labour and pro-remain Conservatives. To have any chance of beating their 2005 record, let alone heading towards the 100 MPs mark, they will also need a large increase in campaign funding. (Hint to potential donors.) Much will still depend on the circumstances. If the Tories manage to get Britain out of the EU with a Brexit deal before going to an election, their Brexit party rival will be robbed of its raison d’être and remainers will feel deflated. If, however, the election happens before Brexit, there is a real chance of getting a Lib-Lab coalition that would give Britain what it really needs: a second referendum with the option to stay in the EU. And a second chance for the true, the great, the unrepresented liberal Britain. • Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Thu 22 Aug 2019 21.52 BST As Boris Johnson journeyed back from this week’s desperate trip to Germany and France, he might have reflected on his hero Churchill and those “dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.” Somehow those totems of Britain’s archaic colonisation of Ireland refuse to release their stranglehold on British politics. And here was Johnson at their mercy, being lectured by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on how to govern them. It was intolerable. Johnson got no joy in Berlin or Paris. Merkel’s meaningless 30-day “talks” period was greeted with ecstasy by his Tory press claque. But Macron merely pointed out that nothing had changed. The steeples were still there, telling London what not to do. The 1922 partition was meant to be temporary. It has long been an agony for Britain As of now, the Downing Street cabal of Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove may have a plan, however costly, on how to crash out of the European Union’s customs union. They still have no plan for Northern Ireland. There, no deal promises the ultimate horror, of a return to policing the 1921 partitioning of Ireland, this time with some ramshackle arrangement of border posts, customs checks and massive evasion. The partition was meant to be temporary. It has long been an agony for Britain, leaving it with an overseas province divided on religious lines and simmering with hostility towards and from its neighbour in the south. Two decades ago the Good Friday agreement appeared to ease the tension. Economic convergence replaced political antagonism. At long last, Northern Ireland generated good news, not bad. A soft Brexit offered no change to this state of grace. It honoured the economic union of Ireland by keeping the UK within the customs union and single market. But Johnson wants a hard Brexit. In his letter to the EU this week, he openly trumpeted “divergence” in trading standards, regulations and tariffs within the island of Ireland. He seeks to liberate Northern Ireland, as an indissoluble part of the UK, from what he sees as intolerable intrusion by outsiders in UK laws and regulations. He somehow believes these intrusions would not apply to trade with China or the US. He disagrees with Macron, that British free trade with China or America would lead to more insistent “vassalisation” than anything from Brussels. To avoid fixed barriers across 300 miles of lanes and cart tracks in Northern Ireland, Johnson now imagines a “virtual” border, bureaucratic and technological, pulled back from the frontier to a digital wonderland of trusted traders, certificates, surveillance cameras, inspection points and passport checks. These would be located somewhere between the Irish border and Belfast airport and docks. The same checks would have to apply to the £3bn a year of British goods moving south to Dublin and the EU. Trucks would flow as now, but the customs would catch up with them later on, to monitor animal health and food standards, collect tariffs and somehow chase after those evading new limits on EU immigrants. All involved in these negotiations – from Merkel and Macron to the humblest border official – say the same. What is Johnson talking about? A border is a border, wherever located. Trade divergence is divergence, a tariff is a tariff and a check a control. These are frictions, barriers to trade, whether concrete or virtual. Could Johnson please cite just one comparable example of his border, as the EU tariff expert Sabine Weyand asks, “anywhere on Earth?” Or is this just posturing for the rightwing press? Most people I know do not understand the Irish backstop. They treat it like the Schleswig-Holstein question, so impenetrable as to be merely a badge of tribal machismo – for or against. That “question” too was over a provincial border, and it took Prussia to war twice with Denmark. Borders are real. They are not just gates. They mark out the geography of sovereignty. They need guards and they draw blood. The Irish backstop is not a guarantee, as the EU calls it. It is a demand that London acknowledges its blatant inconsistency. Northern Ireland cannot both remain in commercial union with the rest of Ireland and yet join whole-heartedly in Johnson’s new WTO regime for Britain. There is no point in kicking this can down the road. Britain should confront the contradictions long inherent in Northern Ireland’s ambiguous status. The EU is saying to Britain, grow up. In the present context of hard Brexit, this can only lead in one of two directions. The EU can back off and indeed agree to kick the can down the road. It can pretend to time-limit the Irish backstop and see what happens. If that might reactivate Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, permit Brexit in October and let tempers cool for a negotiation of a new trade deal in the transition, it might be worth it. But in reality it would just postpone the agony, and the EU clearly has no intention of doing that, however much Johnson puffs and blusters. Or the prime minister could defy the DUP and agree to a separate, soft-Brexit status for Northern Ireland in relation to the south. This would accept some border arrangement down the Irish Sea, with a de facto border at sea ports. It would eliminate any need for the backstop. Brexit could proceed as Johnson promised on 31 October. One thing is heavily on the side of the second option. Northern Ireland did not vote to leave but to remain, and by 56%. Since then polls by LucidTalk are unequivocal. Sixty percent of Northern Irish voters are for some continued customs link to Ireland, explicitly separate from the rest of the UK. Even within the Unionist community, 40% are happy about a border down the Irish Sea. This surely is a sign of Northern Ireland’s evolving maturity. The province is a sufficiently distinct political entity, like Scotland, to be entitled to self-determination. If that brings it closer to Dublin, so be it. This must be the moment for Johnson to call the DUP’s bluff. If Britain really is to crash out of the EU in two months, there will have to be border controls somewhere round the shores of the Irish Sea. The EU cannot let Ireland become open country for smuggling. Nor can Britain accept a flood of incoming EU food when its own exports are subject to EU tariffs. A majority in the north is clearly ready for exceptional status. Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom. It might be drawn more into the orbit of the south, but that has already been the consequence of the Good Friday agreement – and a welcome one. It is better than a slither back to super-partition, as horribly echoed in this week’s paramilitary shooting in Belfast. Northern Ireland must one day free itself from the shackles of its past, shackles that still drearily hang round its political neck. It cannot be too much to imagine a beneficial legacy of Brexit being the liberation of the province from this anachronistic incubus, a legacy that steers all of Ireland on a path, however slowly, towards a stable and contented union. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.25 BST The campaign to ensure that employers must protect women going through the menopause (MPs call for compulsory menopause policies in workplaces, 26 August) has to be supported, but should be extended to include those countless women who experience the devastating effects of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is estimated that 800,000 women experience symptoms so severe that their physical, psychological, social and economic wellbeing is significantly compromised. The menopausal cases cited in the article could just have easily been representative of women suffering from PMS. The National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (Naps), has, since its inception in 1984, been working to further the interests of PMS sufferers. One area of concern has been how women cope with their condition in the workplace. It would be a major step forward if this concern could be acknowledged by parliament. To this end we aim to collaborate with those now seeking to protect menopausal women. If we are jointly successful, the benefits to personal health, family life and the economy will be inestimable.Jackie HoweCEO, Naps • I heartily support the idea of mandatory menopause policies in the workplace – particularly as the retirement age is now rising and in my view employers, recruitment agencies and training providers are in no way prepared. I am now 64 and in the Waspi category of women. I took voluntary redundancy from a quango in 2017, on the basis that “if you don’t accept voluntary it will be compulsory next time”. Prior to that, I had really struggled with menopausal symptoms. My concerns were never addressed. The office was always overheated so that it was difficult to concentrate. If you opened a window you were effectively “sent to Coventry” by other members of staff.Name and address supplied • Your article is worthy of the widest circulation. My employers were wonderful about managing my menopausal symptoms. When I came home, though, I used to open the fridge and freezer doors and just stand there luxuriating in the almost instant change.Pat McCarthyBrentford, London • Surely this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Most of my female friends survived the hot flushes with the minimum of medical and legal intervention. This is a natural process and does not need to be pathologised. A bit of consideration and tact usually does the trick – and HRT when available. (Wo)man up, ladies. Jane GhoshBristol • In your recent welcome articles on the menopause, it’s usually said that hot flushes can continue for a decade (Funding gap has left questions unanswered, 27 August). My mother was still having them well into her 80s and I am too, at age 70. For some, the effects of the menopause are lifelong.Jenny HaynesHorkstow, North Lincolnshire • Please take greater care when choosing your vocabulary to describe the menopause. In an otherwise well-intentioned article (What is the menopause and when does it strike?, 26 August), the use of emotive terms such as “strike”, “hit”, and “ramping things down” is unhelpful. As Germaine Greer wrote: “The experience of the menopause is and will remain undescribed because menopause is a non-event. It doesn’t happen on a day or in a place. It is not announced, or applauded or deplored. It is not the last menstruation, which is by definition pre-menopausal, not to mention that you can’t know that a menstruation is your last until months have passed” (The Change: Women, Ageing, and Menopause, Bloomsbury, 2018). What your article describes is the perimenopause. Women’s experiences of this transition vary greatly, from being barely noticeable to being disruptive and debilitating. I welcome the increasingly open discussion of the subject, but please can we employ sensible language? And in answer to the final question – yes, there is plenty to look forward to.Judith LaityHelperby, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.25 BST As someone who has written about the similarities between recent Italian and British politics, I welcome Martin Kettle’s attempt to interest a wider audience in this correspondence (Britain and Italy are now the terrible twins of Europe, 22 August). But he overlooked a fundamental commonality driving the rise of nationalistic-populistic politics in both countries: the widespread disillusionment with political institutions and representatives. In Italy this sentiment grew with the botched attempts to reform the system after the tangentopoli (“bribesville”) scandal. In the UK the turning point was probably the MPs’ expenses scandal. Reinforcing the damage done by both of these scandals was the leading parties’ readiness to follow the dictates of finance elites for austerity measures. In that respect, at least, the present Labour party is one step ahead of the Italian left, in seeking to move away from the sellout to neoliberal interests.Bryn JonesUniversity of Bath • I agree with many of the points made in Martin Kettle’s comparison of Britain and Italy, and usually the resignation of a prime minister is a serious matter in both countries, though less so in Italy. But the current crisis in Italy has been “masterminded” (if that is possible) by Matteo Salvini, who – quite ignorant of Italy’s laws and constitution – thought he could appeal directly to voters to become Italy’s supremo, and intended to campaign from the position of interior minister. He did not realise that in parliament his party has only about 17% control, and therefore it is just possible that Salvini will lose his position of power and a “caretaker government” may be formed, with the exclusion of the League, so that the 2020 budget can be discussed and approved. If that were the case, I wish the other “terrible” twin would follow suit, and Boris Johnson and his gang be defeated by the “anti-fanatic” forces in Britain, whatever they may be. Though I know that “spes ultima dea”. Amen.Diego ZancaniOxford • Martin Kettle’s article reminded me of an incident that occurred nearly 50 years ago when I was living in Italy. On one occasion when hitchhiking with my boyfriend from Rome to Florence we were given a lift by a Communist party senator with whom we discussed the political situation in our respective countries. The senator described politics in Britain as “stagnant”. I was somewhat shocked at this because until then I had thought of British politics as relatively … well, stable compared with Italian politics with its continuous coalitions! I imagine the senator would hardly say the same today!Virginia Middleton-SmithBishopstone, East Sussex • Martin Kettle makes an interesting and valid comparison between Britain and Italy, but a far more useful lesson is to be learned from Spain which has leapfrogged Britain in political maturity. Not so long ago Spain was regarded as something close to a developing country, ever in danger of returning to the dictatorship it had just left behind. As late as the 1990s Britain smugly frowned on unskilled Spanish workers arriving as unwanted immigrants and Britons settled in Spain because there they weren’t asked too many questions about their offshore accounts. Now Spain is a sophisticated democracy capable of weathering political crises (the financial crash, a royal abdication, Catalan secession, the legacy of Francoism reborn in Vox…) with a sense of measure that Britain could only dream of. Like Britain, it has a minority government but it has not fallen into the hands of a sect of rightwing extremists and has not torn itself apart over an anachronistic obsession with going it alone in the world as if it wasn’t really part of Europe. Perhaps Spain has succeeded because it faced up to the truth in 1975-80 and is still facing up to it, whereas in 1979 Britain began to slip into a delusion. Spain has a constitution that commits all parties (in both senses) to working together and it keeps its monarchy in its place rather than ceding a vague royal prerogative (“do what you want as long as no one objects”) to the prime minister of the day. Not everything is perfect, of course, but whereas Spain (along with Italy) once looked like the political joke of Europe, now guess who everyone is laughing at.Nick InmanLarreule, France • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.25 BST Donald Trump was characteristically unaware of the ironic significance of his metaphor about freeing ourselves from the “anchor” of the EU (Britain can ‘easily cope’ with no deal, claims Johnson at G7, 26 August). Rather than getting himself into a pickle over pork pies, Boris Johnson could have responded with the absurd fact that it has been illegal for decades for the Pentagon to acquire anchor chain from a foreign supplier. That embargo has nothing to do with national security, of course, but is a tiny manifestation of the all-pervasive, deep-rooted protectionism of the land of the free. It is not only the likes of Boeing and Pfizer that lobby Congress and the administration mercilessly and successfully: even a small company can readily bend the ear of a tame representative in Washington, with far-reaching and long-standing consequences. So much of the US single market is closed to outsiders more firmly than the one we are leaving. When I worked there, it was disturbing that so many Americans – far more educated, aware and sensible than Trump – failed to see the hypocrisy of their policies and laws. Overcoming such an anti-competitive, nationalistic mindset will certainly not be a cinch. Geoff MagnusDefence counsellor, British embassy, Washington, 1997-2000 • Perhaps understandably your correspondents assessing Boris Johnson’s G7 summit turn the spotlight on the twin pillars of Brexit and the transatlantic relationship. One notable aspect of the prime minister’s performance has sadly escaped attention: namely, his role in championing an international development issue that the G7 has ducked. Boris Johnson arrived in Biarritz with an important pledge for children around the world affected by war and humanitarian emergency. He has committed the UK to spending £90m over three years in support of a little-known, but highly effective, mechanism for financing education provision for children like the Rohingya now living as refugees in Bangladesh, but also for refugees from Syria, South Sudan and other countries. This is an investment that could help keep alive the hope of education for more than 600,000 children. Many more need help – and, having demonstrated leadership by example, Britain is well placed to call on other G7 partners to step up. The increasingly polarised debate on Brexit will doubtless continue. But whatever the outcome of that debate, the UK’s actions on refugee education surely underscore the values that must define Global Britain. Whatever the architecture of our future relationship with Europe, the UK is, and must remain, an international development superpower.Kevin WatkinsCEO, Save the Children • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.25 BST Your article (Actors protest over the ‘Jewface’ casting of play, 24 August) was a response to the open letter sent by 22 Jewish actors, directors and playwrights criticising the upcoming production of Falsettos at The Other Palace theatre. Though I find use of the term “Jewface” grating, Jewish cultural appropriation is a serious problem on London stages. Falsettos’ production company, Selladoor, said it did not ask cast members about religion, gender, age or race because it would be inappropriate to do so, but fails to realise that Jewish culture doesn’t fall exclusively under any of those categories; setting aside whether white-presenting Jews are white, Judaism isn’t just a religion or ethnicity. So when we talk about Jewish culture, specifically in theatre, Jewish representation can fall through the cracks – whitewashed, or attributed to actors of other BAME backgrounds. This predicament is exacerbated by the fact that a vast percentage of musical theatre is written by Jews. And when Jews write about Jews, they often do so with a big helping of self-deprecation. But most of this Jewish musical theatre is imported from New York, where context is different. Jews are less marginalised on Broadway. Jewish culture isn’t part of British culture the way it is part of American culture, especially in theatre. Prejudice against Jews is different here. In March, the Guardian published an article about the secret history of UK Jewish theatre, and the challenges theatre-makers face. When a Jewish audience member on Broadway hears non-Jewish actors sing Falsettos’ opening number, Four Jews in a Room Bitching, it feels different from how it does in London. It’s the difference between being in on the joke, or the joke being on you.David DjemalCo-founder and writer for the JEWish Cabaret, London"

The 52:48 result is a small majority, and it wasn’t a majority at all in many parts of Britain.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.20 BST Innovation is transforming the way we generate and consume power, with future energy needs being met through subsidy-free renewables balanced by on-site battery storage. The government has set out strong ambitions for the UK to be a world leader in flexible generation, most recently through the plans for a new Smart Export Guarantee. However, its rhetoric is not being matched by action. In the last two years Ofgem has removed embedded benefits for distributed generation and storage, de-rated benefits for batteries in the capacity market and eliminated feed-in tariffs for rooftop solar. Government now also plans to increase network charges and hike VAT for homeowners who invest in residential solar and storage. This stop-start approach of endless consultation, coupled with regulatory decisions that contradict stated policy, has made the UK less attractive for investors in renewable energy infrastructure, with many projects now delayed or cancelled. If the prime minister is serious about maximising the advantages from the shift to decentralised energy, the government must set clearer targets and a roadmap for reform of our electricity system and show greater urgency in putting in place the framework for an open market in flexible generation.Dr Nina Skorupska Renewable Energy Association, Dr Howard Porter British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers’ Association, Dirk Kaisers, Eaton, Tom Pakenham Kaluza, Patrick Caiger-Smith Geo, Juliet Davenport Good Energy, Steve Sharratt iBMS Solutions, James Basden Zenobe"

In this way I acquired almost a complete set of PG Wodehouse first editions for a friend. Richard took to buying huge libraries from all over the English-speaking world. I once bought a copy of Life on the English Manor: A Study of Peasant Conditions 1150-1400 for a quid. Inside was the library stamp of the Arkansas Seminary library with the form for borrowers to list their names. Only one person had ever taken it out, and that was Bill Clinton. But once it all imploded – with locals parading with placards on to which were stapled Richard’s bounced cheques – other book dealers moved in and Hay became truly a town of books.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 20.13 BST Walter Cronkite once said that “journalism is what we need to make democracy work.” He was absolutely right, which is why today’s assault on journalism by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley and Donald Trump presents a crisis – and why we must take concrete action. Real journalism is different from the gossip, punditry and clickbait that dominates today’s news. Real journalism, in the words of Joseph Pulitzer, is the painstaking reporting that will “fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, [and] always fight demagogues”. Pulitzer said journalism must always “oppose privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty”. When we have had real journalism, we have seen crimes like Watergate exposed and confronted, leading to anti-corruption reforms. When we have lacked real journalism, we have seen crimes like mortgage fraud go unnoticed and unpunished, leading to a devastating financial crisis that destroyed millions of Americans’ lives. Real journalism requires significant resources. One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy. One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy For example, two Silicon Valley corporations – Facebook and Google – control 60% of the entire digital advertising market. They have used monopolistic control to siphon off advertising revenues from news organizations. A recent study by the News Media Alliance, a trade organization, found that in 2018, as newspaper revenues declined, Google made $4.7bn off reporting that Google did not pay for. At the same time, corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures have bought and consolidated beleaguered local newspapers and slashed their newsrooms – all while giving executives big payouts. Gannett’s proposed merger with Gatehouse Media, for instance, will consolidate hundreds of publications under one mega-corporation’s control and slash $300m worth of “synergies” – which is often corporate-speak for layoffs. Matt Pearce, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, notes that “the new Gannett/Gatehouse chief executive is getting $4.5m in bonuses and stock just for walking in the door.” The result of these trends has been the decimation of journalism. Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 communities across the country have lost newspapers, which are the outlets local television, radio and digital news sites rely on for reporting. Since 2008, we have seen newsrooms lose 28,000 employees – and in the past year alone, 3,200 people in the media industry have been laid off. Today, for every working journalist, there are six people now working in public relations, often pushing a corporate line. At precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis, the climate emergency and economic inequality, we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip, as local news outlets are eviscerated. The negative effects are predictable: according to a working paper by researchers at Notre Dame and the University of Illinois, when newsrooms are hollowed out, overall costs to taxpayers rise, because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions. A study published by Spotlight on Poverty and Opportunity, a non-partisan forum, found that, despite millions of Americans struggling to survive, budget-strapped “newsrooms have not turned their attention to poverty”. To be sure, when we see the Miami Herald exposé on Jeffrey Epstein or the Charleston Gazette-Mail’s courageous reporting on the opioid crisis, we know that good reporters are still overcoming the odds and managing to produce essential journalism that scrutinizes power, exposes wrongdoing, and challenges the status quo. But we know that those success stories are too often the exception and not the norm. We also know that Donald Trump is making things far worse. He is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies. Worse, he has called the media the “enemy of the people” in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press. Trump’s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected. But let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse. When newsrooms are hollowed out, overall costs to taxpayers rise, because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions. Today, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read and download. Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and “benevolent” billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny. After all, TV networks that rely on $4.5bn a year of pharmaceutical ads may be thrilled to sugarcoat our current dysfunctional healthcare system – but they will never provide a consistently fair hearing for something like Medicare for All, even though polls show that a majority of Americans support such a proposal. Corporate media organizations sponsored by fossil fuel industry ads may gladly provide a platform for guests who insist that our current oligarchic economy is just great, but as studies show, the same outlets often downplay or omit coverage of the climate crisis that those advertisers are helping create. And news outlets owned by Disney and Jeff Bezos may happily tout Disney films and Bezos’s plans for space exploration, but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers’ fight for better wages at Disney – or Bezos-controlled companies. In fact, in one instance, we saw that the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, tried to punish a reporter because he spoke out for better wages at the newspaper. We need to rebuild and protect a diverse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires. When I am president, my administration will put in place policies that will reform the media industry and better protect independent journalism at both the local and national levels. For example, we will reverse the Trump administration’s attempts to make corporate media mergers even more likely in the future. We are not going to rubber-stamp proposals like the new plan to merge CBS and Viacom into a $30bn colossus. I have long opposed media consolidation, and was one of only 16 members of the US House to oppose the disastrous 1996 Telecommunications Act, which accelerated consolidation. In my administration, we are going to institute an immediate moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations until we can better understand the true effect these transactions have on our democracy. In the spirit of existing federal laws, we will start requiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs. We will also require that, before any future mergers can take place, employees must be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock-ownership plans – an innovative business model that was first pioneered in the newspaper industry. And we will prevent media-related merger and deregulation decisions at federal agencies that adversely affect people of color and women. As the not-for-profit watchdog group Free Press has noted, “Women and people of color are woefully underrepresented among broadcast-license holders.” The group points out that this is because when the Federal Communications Commission has approved mergers it has failed “to consider how such concentration affects ownership opportunities for women and people of color”. When our administration appoints new, progressive leadership at the FCC, we will reverse the Trump administration’s moves, which have gutted longstanding media ownership rules. What Trump has done allows cross-ownership of newspapers and television or radio stations; he has also given the green light to owning multiple stations in the same market. The harm may be great: “In theory,” says Free Press, “these changes would allow a single broadcaster to own both your local newspaper and your top-two local broadcast stations, plus operate a handful of other stations through sharing agreements – turning your community into a one-newsroom town.” We will do the opposite: we will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules, and we will limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide. We will also direct federal agencies to study the impact of consolidation in print, television and digital media to determine whether further antitrust action is necessary. Additionally, we will pass my Workplace Democracy Plan, which will boost media workers’ laudable efforts to form unions and collectively bargain with their employers. I have publicly supported journalists’ efforts to unionize. Unions not only fight for media workers’ wages and benefits, they can also better protect reporters from corporate policies that aim to prevent journalists from scrutinizing media owners and their advertisers. We cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda Finally, when it comes to Silicon Valley, I will appoint an attorney general as well as Federal Trade Commission officials who more stringently enforce antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google, to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations. Their monopoly power has particularly harmed small, independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back. We must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies, and we should consider taxing targeted ads and using the revenue to fund not-for-profit civic-minded media. That will be part of an overall effort to substantially increase funding for programs that support public media’s news-gathering operations at the local level – in much the same way many other countries already fund independent public media. Our constitution’s first amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy. More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda. We must take action – and if we do, I know we can be successful. We can and will restore the media that Joseph Pulitzer and Walter Cronkite envisioned, and that America so desperately needs.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 20.39 BST Boris Johnson has been described as a threat to the “very nature” of British democracy at a cross-party meeting where MPs agreed to form an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down the existing one to make a no-deal Brexit happen. In a symbolic gathering at Church House in Westminster, where MPs met during the second world war, Labour’s John McDonnell took to the stage alongside the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry as well as the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Caroline Lucas of the Green party. They signed the Church House declaration, which said shutting down parliament would be “an undemocratic outrage at such a crucial moment for our country, and a historic constitutional crisis”. The pronouncement added: “Any attempt to prevent parliament [from] sitting, to force through a no-deal Brexit, will be met by strong and widespread democratic resistance.” McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who said the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had been stuck in meetings, told those assembled: “Prime ministers come and prime ministers go, but I don’t think we have seen a prime minister like this who has had the potential to threaten the very nature of our democracy.” McDonnell said he wanted to warn Johnson that MPs will use “whatever mechanism necessary” to prevent the prime minister from proroguing parliament. Organisers said more than 160 MPs from a range of parties signed the declaration. Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National party in the House of Commons, said the government posed a threat to the security of citizens, while Lucas said: “We will block what is nothing less than a coup.” Swinson said MPs had come together to make the point that they would not stand by while the government pursued a “catastrophic no-deal Brexit”. Although Conservative MPs were conspicuous by their absence from the event, Soubry, who left the Tories to join the Independent Group for Change, spoke on stage with McDonnell sitting beside her. She said she hoped the history books would record their determination and courage and show there were those who acted while others stood by and did nothing. “You all know who the people of courage are and those who have failed to exercise it,” Soubry said. “They will stop you in the corridors and say, ‘Of course this is absolute madness’, but they will not go and do the right thing, which is to be true to their principles.”"

Jessica Elgot Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.36 BST


First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.42 BST EU officials are ready to look at “realistic” proposals from Boris Johnson on the Irish backstop – the main obstacle to a Brexit deal – but are pessimistic about his government’s chances of coming up with workable ideas. Downing Street’s optimism over an apparent shift in the EU’s willingness to negotiate could be scuppered by a new Irish push to reinforce the importance of the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland. Johnson’s Europe envoy, David Frost, is due to return to Brussels on Wednesday for meetings with officials as both sides strive to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. After the G7 summit and meetings with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Berlin and Paris, the EU is taking the prime minister more seriously as a dealmaker. EU officials now think he is genuine about wanting an agreement, but are sceptical he can bring his party with him. One senior EU official told the Guardian the sequence of meetings in Berlin, Paris and Biarritz had introduced a new dynamic: “While we are not in a situation where we are thinking that Johnson is really serious about a deal, at least there is that possibility that he might be and that is a big change.” “The political arithmetic hasn’t changed, the political timetable hasn’t changed. But we have to listen and we have to look [at his ideas],” the official added. Johnson spoke to the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Tuesday evening. A commission statement said that in the call “President Juncker repeated his willingness to work constructively with prime minister Johnson and to look at any concrete proposals he may have, as long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement. A ‘no-deal’ scenario will only ever be the UK’s decision, not the EU’s.” A Downing Street source said that there was still not a substantive “openness to action” despite a “shift in rhetoric” from EU leaders. No 10 believes the EU27 must consider whether to approve a new negotiating mandate, something hinted at by Juncker in his call with Johnson. “That would be a sign they are serious about this,” a source said. The EU sees a chance to reach a deal after Johnson declared in Berlin last week that he was more than happy to accept a “blistering timetable” of 30 days to find a compromise. This U-turn from his previous refusal to talk unless the EU scrapped the backstop was seen as an important shift in the UK accepting the onus of finding the solution. Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements. It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact. Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work. The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish sea, which is anathema to the unionist party. Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU's customs union permanently if the UK & EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc. Joint interpretative instrument A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try and get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible. Unilateral statement from the UK This set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement. Additional language in political declaration This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it 'reduces the risk' of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it. Prime minister Boris Johnson  declared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead” during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he re-negotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement for re-negotiation. Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam and Peter Walker “The ball is in London’s court,” said an EU diplomat. “Boris Johnson hasn’t tabled a concrete plan, but there is certainly a slight hope that a solution can be found.” It is understood No 10 believes there has been a “rhetorical shift” from the EU compared with a month ago when the backstop and withdrawal agreement were considered sacrosanct. This subtle change has been signalled by the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who said the bloc was ready to analyse British proposals that were “realistic, operational and compatible with our principles”. Diplomats have pointed out that the backstop is written as a protocol, separate to the withdrawal agreement. Although this interpretation is not shared by all Brussels insiders, such nuances could open the way to a face-saving compromise. Legal niceties aside, all EU officials stress that any alternative to the backstop must do the same job. “A withdrawal agreement … without having an insurance policy is not going to work,” said another EU diplomat. “We are quite serious about looking at proposals from the UK side to do it differently.” The diplomat said they were “not optimistic” Johnson could deliver. “We haven’t seen anything from the UK yet that gives an indication of where they want to go and therefore there is nothing we can entertain.” Johnson is expected to meet Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin early next week, a meeting that a Downing Street source described as “clearly crucial”. Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, started a five-city Brexit tour of EU capitals on Tuesday to reinforce the importance of the backstop and Good Friday agreement for Ireland’s economic and social stability, in a challenge to the perception that the EU is showing signs of flexibility on the measure. In an indication that no real breakthrough had been made at the G7 meeting in Biarritz, Coveney said on Tuesday during a visit to Prague that the alternative arrangements proposed in the UK did not come “close” to the guarantees needed and provided for by the backstop. “I think we need to be honest here, that the alternative arrangements that have been discussed to date, do not do the same job as the backstop – not even close. And so let’s not pretend that solutions exist when they might not,” he said. The narrow landing ground for a deal was illustrated by the cool reaction in Brussels to an alternative backstop plan drafted by a British former commission official and two academics. Jonathan Faull, who led the commission taskforce during David Cameron’s renegotiation, and his colleagues said they had come up with “an offer the EU and UK cannot refuse”. The plan would allow different regulatory standards in Northern Ireland and Ireland while avoiding the need for a sea border. It would require the UK and Ireland to make it a criminal offence to knowingly export goods across the frontier that breached standards on either side. The proposal has attracted “considerable interest”, the authors told Politico. But the senior EU official said it was a retread of Theresa May’s doomed Chequers plan, rejected by Brussels partly because it required the EU to outsource customs controls to the UK. “It is magical thinking written in very polite and crisp English,” the source said. Even if Johnson comes up with proposals that have eluded the British government for the last three years, he may have run out of time to pass them through parliament, where he has a majority of one. EU insiders are also unconvinced that Johnson’s advisers or the Conservative party would support a compromise. “Is no deal better to secure his [Johnson’s] own position?” asked one diplomat. “Yes, because anything else will lead to the breakup of the Tory party. I do not see this Tory government going for a deal. That is what troubles me.” A UK government spokesperson said: “We are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative to the backstop with provisions to ensure the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. “The UK government is working at pace to find a wide range of flexible and creative solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.”"

17:42 My colleagues Aditya Chakrabortty, Richard Adams and Sally Weale have just published an exclusive detailing a raft of dramatic and controversial education policy proposals set out in a confidential briefing paper. The measures include billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, which are set to be announced by the government within days. The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked “Official-Sensitive”, details a blizzard of policy proposals designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in a bid to seize the initiative on education ahead of a possible autumn election. While proposals including a £3.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers’ basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to improve behaviour.

17:25 Jonathan Lis, deputy director of the thinktank British Influence, has written for our opinion pages welcoming today’s opposition talks. Today’s meeting is highly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that, when push comes to shove, politicians who may personally dislike or distrust each other can sit around a table and work seriously, cordially and productively. Second, and more importantly, it highlights that MPs have the means at their disposal to stop no deal. They already had the numbers. Now they are showing the willing. 5.09pm BST
17:09 The Conservative party has tweeted accusing opposition politicians of “plotting to cancel the votes of 17.4 million people”. Change UK leader, Anna Soubry, who was a Tory MP until February this year, said the message was yet more proof that “right wing ideologues” had taken over her old party. These 6 politicians are plotting to cancel the votes of 17.4 million people.🔵 We respect the result of the EU Referendum.🔵 We will get Brexit done by October 31st and take this country forward.✍️ Show them they can't ignore it.➡️ https://t.co/sosWZSPztl pic.twitter.com/5yLJEiyfYP Today these MPs put aside their differences to ensure Parliament isn’t suspended to enable a disastrous #NoDeal #Brexit for which there’s no mandate.@Conservatives should be throughly ashamed of this disingenuous tweet- further proof the right wing ideologues have taken it over. https://t.co/m5S0yAq8kC 4.23pm BST
16:23 The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has responded to an invitation from MPs to chair a “citizens’ forum on Brexit” in which alternatives to a no deal would be discussed. It’s an unexpected privilege to be asked to chair the proposed Citizens’ Forum on Brexit. In the past such gatherings have opened the way for careful deliberation. I’m open in principle – provided the Forum doesn’t aim to stop or delay Brexit, and has cross-party support. https://t.co/pYLYUDFzwJ He has issued a statement on his website: It is an unexpected privilege to be asked to chair this proposed citizens’ forum on Brexit. In the past this kind of gathering has, in many places and in difficult situations, opened the way for careful deliberation if at the right time and genuinely representative. I am honoured to be approached and would be willing to accept in principle, subject to some conditions which have not yet been met. The main three are first, and indispensably, that the forum should not be a Trojan horse intended to delay or prevent Brexit in any particular form. That power can only be exercised by the government and MPs in parliament. A forum must be open to all possibilities. Second, that it has cross-party support (although its members will not be politicians). Third, the process must have time to be properly organised. Jesus Christ is the source of reconciliation and healing for individuals and society. It is obviously right that among many others the churches should contribute to the emergence of a dynamic and united country post-Brexit, however it may be achieved. Every one of us must play the part they can in this task. The need for national healing and eventually for a move towards reconciliation is essential, and will take much time, a deep commitment to the common good, and contributions from every source. This forum is only one of many different efforts being made inside the political world and across the country before and after Brexit. Every effort counts. Let us pray for all those in government, parliament and political leadership. Let us pray for the people of this country whose lives will be affected in many ways by the momentous decisions that are made. Responding to earlier reports that Welby had met with MPs to discuss hosting a possible citizens’ assembly, the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: I generally don’t criticise the archbishop but he shouldn’t allow himself to be tempted into what is essentially a very political issue right now. This assembly is designed to destabilise Boris Johnson’s position. As such I hope he will recognise the deeply political nature of this. Updated

15:28 Ben Quinn Our reporter Ben Quinn attended a symbolic meeting of MPs in Church House where they discussed their opposition to no-deal Brexit. He filed this report. Boris Johnson was described as a threat to the very nature of British democracy at a cross party meeting of MPs who signed a pledge to an alternative parliament in the event of the prime minister shutting down parliament to make a no deal Brexit happen. In a highly symbolic gathering in Church House, where MPs met during the second world war, Labour’s John McDonnell took to the stage alongside the former Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, as well as the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas of the Green Party. Each one signed the ‘Church House Declaration,’ which declared that shutting down parliament would be “an undemocratic outrage at such a crucial moment for our country, and a historic constitutional crisis.” It added: “Any attempt to prevent Parliament sitting, to force through a no deal Brexit, will be met by strong and widespread democratic resistance.” The shadow chancellor, who said that Jeremy Corbyn had been trapped in meetings, told those assembled: “Prime Ministers come and Prime Ministers go but I don’t think we have seen a Prime Minister like this who has had the potential to threaten the vary nature of our democracy.” I want to warn him that we will not and let that happen, said McDonnell, who added that MPs will use “whatever mechanism necessary” to thwart Johnson.More than 160 MPs from a range of parties were said by organisors to have signed the declaration.Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, said that the government posed a threat to the security of citizens, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “We will block what is nothing less than a coup.”Swinson said that members of parliament had come together to make the point that they would not stand by while the government sent the country into a “catastrophic no deal Brexit.”While Conservative MPs were conspicuous by their absence from the event, there was a highly symbolic moment when the former Tory MP and minister addressed the even standing on stage while McDonnell sat beside her.She said that she hoped that when the history books were written they would record their determination and courage and show that there were those who acted while others stood by and did nothing. “You all know who the people of courage are and those who have failed to exercise it.

15:05 The Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to 116 Tory MPs, including former prime minister Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Greg Clark, urging them to support cross-party efforts to stop no-deal Brexit. Here’s the full text of the letter: Dear colleague, I am writing to you after convening a meeting earlier today with the leaders of other opposition parties on how we can work together, across Parliament to prevent a damaging No Deal exit from the European Union. At that meeting, we agreed to make efforts to put party politics aside to find a way through the present crisis. We know there is a majority in parliament against No Deal. As MPs we’ve voted against No Deal on a number of occasions and we did so in the largest number on 27 March of this year. As you were one of 116 Conservative or independent MPs who voted against No Deal that day and are not on the government frontbench, I am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent No Deal. This is an urgent task. The Prime Minister is reportedly planning to suspend parliament to force through a No Deal crash out. This action would be, according to legal advice I’ve received from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, “the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory”. My view is that holding a general election after an extension is achieved is the simplest and most democratic way to prevent No Deal and to let the people of this country decide our future. Indeed, it is the best route to a referendum or leaving the EU with a deal. I understand not all colleagues may agree. So I would like to invite you to join a dialogue with myself, as leader of the Labour Party, and other opposition parties, to find a way for the clear will of parliament against No Deal to express itself. Please respond by email. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn Updated

14:58 Jessica Elgot This from our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot on Sajid Javid’s cancelled speech. The chancellor has been meeting Trump’s treasury secretary on Tuesday. The first major speech by the chancellor Sajid Javid has been mysteriously cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said that the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been due to take place later this year, was now being fast-tracked to take place in early September, adding fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. The speech, which was due to take place in Birmingham, was billed as Javid “outlining his vision for the UK economy.” In an email to attendees, the Treasury press office said the speech was being rescheduled but gave no other reasoning. “The forthcoming Spending Round will instead be brought forward in early September and will cover the themes and priorities he was due to outline,” the email said.

Virginia Giuffre had already alleged in 2011 testimony that Andrew “knows the truth” about Epstein’s abuse of underage girls and said he should be made to testify. In a December 2014 court filing she alleged that she was made to have sex with Andrew and other friends of Epstein. The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations. In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were “immaterial and impertinent” and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein. On Tuesday, Giuffre spoke to reporters outside federal court in Manhattan. She was one of nearly two dozen women who spoke about alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during a unique court proceeding scheduled after the financier’s death in prison on 10 August, which was ruled a suicide. Epstein’s death at 66 brought an end to his criminal case but the judge gave accusers the opportunity to speak publicly. “He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that,” Giuffre said about Prince Andrew, a video of the press conference showed. “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.” Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing a number of Epstein accusers, said that “with respect to Prince Andrew or anyone else who made statements, gratuitous statements, if anyone wants to come over here and talk with us, and answer real questions that the victims have, and that we have on their behalf, we welcome that invitation. “I personally extended that invitation to Prince Andrew multiple times. Any time, we are ready, and we have a lot of questions for him.” Andrew said in a statement last Saturday that he made Epstein’s acquaintance in 1999 and saw him once or twice each year. The prince also said he stayed at several of Epstein’s homes. He said he did not “see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein’s] arrest and conviction”. He added: “I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.” The prince also said: “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. “This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.”"

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 01.00 BST Jeffrey Epstein was called a coward and a “depraved human being” in a New York courtroom on Tuesday by women who accused him of sexually abusing them as teens. They had been expecting their day in court to come as part of the criminal prosecution and trial of Epstein after his arrest in July. But while in life they allege he robbed them of their innocence, with his suicide in a New York jail earlier this month, he robbed them of their chance to confront him in court in person. At a special hearing in Manhattan, alleged victims of the disgraced and now dead financier – whose political and royal connections have come under fresh scrutiny since his arrest in New York – were able to give voice to their anguish. About 20 women spoke in Manhattan federal court early on Tuesday, detailing the emotional turmoil they continue to experience from their interactions with Epstein. The subject of his former girlfriend and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, also came up at the hearing on Tuesday. “Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for many years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,” said accuser Courtney Wild on Tuesday. She continued: “Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for that, he is a coward.” Many Epstein accusers had heralded his 6 July arrest as an opportunity for justice after years of inaction from authorities. But Epstein killed himself in custody in New York on 10 August, bringing an end to the criminal case against him. However, Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman, who was overseeing the case, last week scheduled this morning’s proceeding in light of Epstein’s death, giving his accusers the opportunity to speak. “I feel very angry and sad,” said Wild. “Justice has never been served in this case.” Several women testified in tears. Others choked up as they took their place before the judge to give their accounts of what happened to them and the impact his sudden death has had on his victims. Some women identified themselves, and others preferred to withhold their names. Their ages were not given, but they described being in their teens when they encountered Epstein in the past. The suicide “felt like a whole new trauma all over again”, said one unnamed accuser. “I don’t know why, because I’m trying to defend myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does not feel good. It didn’t feel good to wake up that morning and hear that he had allegedly committed suicide.” Another, who chose to remain anonymous, said: “I’m just angry that he’s not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his actions.” She claimed Epstein sexually assaulted her several months after she moved to New York for modeling as a teenager. Another woman who spoke claimed that Maxwell, long accused of procuring victims for Epstein and of sexual misconduct herself, introduced her to Epstein. The woman alleged that Epstein raped her at his home in the Virgin Islands. “I tried to pull away, but he was already unbuttoning my shorts,” she said. “All I could say was ‘No, please stop,’ but that just seemed to excite [him] more. I spent two weeks vomiting almost to death in a [Los Angeles, California] hospital after that first encounter.” Others were willing to identify themselves and accused Epstein and Maxwell of wrongdoing. “I’m a victim of Jeffey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s international sex trafficking ring,” said accuser Sarah Ransome, who urged prosecutors: “Please, please, finish what you have started.” Maxwell has emphatically denied all allegations of wrongdoing and has gone to great lengths to contest allegations involving her. She was most recently photographed in public in Los Angeles. Alleged victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the court: “I am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the dark and cruel criminal acts they committed against me … for years and years and years unstopped.” Epstein, long accused of abusing teen girls, had been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy counts. “He robbed me of my dreams,” said a woman who accused Epstein of raping her when she was a minor. “He stole my chance of really feeling love.” The US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, alleged that the financier sexually abused minors as young as 14 at his Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City homes between 2002 and 2005. He had pleaded not guilty. Judge Berman said: “Mr Epstein’s death obviously means that a trial in which he is a defendant cannot take place. It is a rather stunning turn of events.” Federal prosecutors in New York and US attorney general William Barr vowed that the investigation into potential co-conspirators would continue. Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida a dozen years ago, rather than face more serious federal charges to allegations involving numerous minors, in a controversial legal deal. He was required to register as a sex offender. He served 13 months in a local jail but then returned to elite society before being arrested last month."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.26 BST Brazil’s far-right president and his backers have escalated their row over the Amazon with Emmanuel Macron, attacking the French president’s “lamentable colonialist stance” as fires continued to rage in the world’s biggest rainforest. As Brazil said it would reject a $20m (£16m) G7 contribution to fight the fires, Jair Bolsonaro spurned Macron’s criticism of his environmental record and flaunted Donald Trump’s support for his far-right administration. “We have nothing against the G7. We have something against one of the G7’s presidents,” Bolsonaro told a summit of governors from the nine states that make up the Brazilian Amazon. Brazil’s leader said he had been cheered by an earlier tweet in which the US president said Bolsonaro was “working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil”. Bolsonaro responded tweeting: “Thank you, President Trump. We’re fighting the wildfires with great success. The fake news campaign built against our sovereignty will not work.” Macron has been less kind to Bolsonaro, a rightwing nationalist who campaigners accuse of greenlighting a new era of environmental destruction and being partly responsible for the scale of this year’s Amazon burning season. Last week, Macron sparked a diplomatic skirmish with Bolsonaro when he called for emergency talks on the Amazon at the G7 summit – a move Bolsonaro responded to by mocking the appearance of Brigitte Macron, France’s first lady, on Facebook. On Monday, Macron lamented Bolsonaro’s “extraordinarily rude” attack on his wife and said he hoped Brazil would soon have a leader worthier of the office. Bolsonaro and his backers hit back on Tuesday. Bolsonaro condemned what he described as Macron’s meddling in Brazilian affairs and insisted he would only consider the G7’s Amazon aid package if Macron withdrew his “insults”. Gen Augusto Heleno, Bolsonaro’s hawkish institutional security chief, took a particularly hard line, lambasting “Macron’s lamentable colonialist stance”. “Ninety percent of [former] French colonies are in a deplorable state,” Heleno, the former head of the Brazil-led United Nations stabilization mission in Haiti, told the gathering of governors. “Wherever they went they left a trail of destruction, chaos and misery. They shouldn’t be giving anyone advice. This is a joke.” Mauro Mendes, the governor of the Amazon state of Mato Grosso, accused Macron of “surfing on the ashes” of the Amazon conflagration for political and economic purposes. “Macron isn’t worried about our environment. He’s worried about creating mechanisms to introduce possible barriers [to Brazilian products],” Mendes claimed. The Amazon assembly in Brasília was convened to discuss responses to the blaze currently sweeping through swaths of the region. But Bolsonaro used the encounter to repeatedly pillory environmentalists and what he called the “psychotic” demarcation of indigenous reserves, claiming both had hamstrung Brazil’s economy. He said: “This environmental question has to be dealt with rationally and not with the almost savagery that it has been throughout previous governments. We cannot allow a country as rich as ours to be in the situation it finds itself in.” He vowed to “take the decisions that need to be taken” to turbo-charge development of the Amazon. Bolsonaro insinuated that indigenous reserves had been created by previous governments as part of a foreign conspiracy designed to hinder Brazil’s economic development. He complained: “Indians don’t do lobbying. They don’t speak our language. And somehow they’ve ended up with 14% of our national territory.” He added: “One of the aims is to make us unworkable.” Bolsonaro also accused Brazilian journalists of waging a “a massive, anti-patriotic, sell-out campaign” against his government by reporting on the Amazon fires. Many of the Amazon governors cheered Bolsonaro’s vision. The governor of Rondônia state, Bolsonaro ally Marcos Rocha, said: “We have always had presidents who thought about environmental protection. Today, we have a president who thinks about protection but who puts human development first.” But there was also pushback. Mendes, the governor of Mato Grosso state said he was “very worried” about how Brazilian farmers might be affected by the negative international reaction to the crisis. “Sixty percent of our GDP comes from our exports,” Mendes noted. The governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, cautioned against spurning foreign aid mechanisms such as the Amazon Fund – to which Norway and Germany recently suspended contributions because of Bolsonaro’s environmental policies. Barbalho warned that Bolsonaro’s clash with Macron was a distraction when Brazil should be attempting to avoid a costly boycott of Brazilian products. He said: “I think we are wasting too much time on Macron. We should take care of our own country and get on with our own lives. we should be taking care of our own problems and showing our environment diplomacy to the world, which is essential to agribusiness.” Flávio Dino, the Communist party governor of Maranhão, also opposed rejecting much-needed international support for environmental protection. “We cannot tear up money – tearing up money is not sensible,” said Dino, a staunch Bolsonaro critic who has described the Brazilian president as the “insane” leader of a “minority sect”. Dino also warned against the “satanization” of environmental NGOs, which Bolsonaro has vowed to expel from the Amazon and accused, without evidence, of starting this year’s fires. “It isn’t by setting NGOs on fire that we are going to save the Amazon,” Dino warned, urging Bolsonaro to show “moderation”."
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/27/brazilian-amazon-deforestation-surges-to-break-august-records,"1,114.8 sq km cut down this month, the same area as Hong Kong – on top of damage from fires Jonathan Watts Global environment editor Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.14 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.55 BST Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has hit the highest August level since the current monitoring system began in 2015, underscoring concerns about the weakening of forest protection under President Jair Bolsonaro. The world’s biggest terrestrial carbon sink lost 1,114.8 sq km (430 sq miles) – equivalent to the area of Hong Kong – in the first 26 days of this month, according to preliminary data from the government’s satellite monitoring agency. The data does not include damage caused by fires currently sweeping parts of the Amazon. After an even greater surge in July, the country has now experienced the two worst months recorded by the Deter-B satellite system, which was put in place in 2015 to provide short-term alerts to forest rangers. Scientists warn this year’s clearcutting of forest is now likely to pass 10,000 sq km for the first time in a decade, raising concerns that Brazil is slipping back towards the dark years of 1995-2004. After annual peaks of over 25,000 sq km around the turn of the century, the government put in place tighter controls, stricter penalties and more efficient monitoring that helped slow deforestation by 80%. This success won Brazil credit around the world as an environmental leader, but the gains have steadily been eroded in the past five years and accelerated rapidly in the last four months. Since taking power at the start of the year, Bolsonaro has downgraded environment protection efforts and made clear that he supports miners, farmers and ranchers above indigenous communities and other forest dwellers. Last month, he fired the head of the National Institute for Space Research, saying the deforestation figures were misleading. Environmentalists say these actions are consistent with the president’s campaign promises to open up the Amazon. “The August data from Deter is hardly surprising,” said Claudio Angelo of Climate Observatory, an NGO coalition of environmental groups. “The current Brazilian government was elected precisely with the promise of dismantling the policies and governance structures that prevent deforestation, and they are duly delivering on it.” “Brazil has since 2004 had a plan for preventing and controlling deforestation in the Amazon. That plan is locked up in a drawer at the environment ministry, which shut down the office in charge of implementing it.” The Deter satellite figures are updated every few days and are considered preliminary, but they are usually a guide to the longer-term trends. More detailed annual figures are released towards the end of the year, after the National Institute for Space Research has calculated data from the more powerful Prodes satellite system. While the deforestation data is only for clearcutting and does not include fire damage, the two issues are often intertwined. Forests near cleared areas tend to be drier and more vulnerable to flames. Farmers and speculators also often use fire to clear land, either to raise its value or to prepare it for crops. Politics and government policy are not the only drivers of forest destruction. US president Donald Trump’s trade war with China has also added to the pressure on the forest because Brazil has made up much of the gap in soy exports. The European Union’s recent deal with the South American trade bloc Mercosur is also likely to increase demand for beef, much of which is from cattle raised on land in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.55 BST As fires continue to rage in Brazil, nearly a million hectares (6,200 sq miles) of farmland and unique dry forest have been destroyed by weeks of blazes across the border in Bolivia, where the flames have now reached the country’s Amazon region. Initial estimates indicate 600 hectares of rainforest have been destroyed in the north-eastern region of Bení, where the fires now threaten indigenous populations. “This is the biggest ever catastrophe for biodiversity in Bolivia,” said Fernando Vargas, an indigenous leader in the Isiboro Sécure Indigenous territory and national park, known as Tipnis by its Spanish acronym. “But this is not a natural disaster but a manmade one,” he told the Guardian. Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, had previously rejected offers of international help to battle the fires, but on Sunday he announced that he would interrupt his re-election campaign for a week to help coordinate foreign aid efforts. “Any cooperation is welcome, whether it comes from international organisations, celebrities or from the presidents who offered to help,” Morales said in Cochabamba, where he had been campaigning for a fourth term in office. The leading opposition candidate, Carlos Mesa, also suspended his election campaign in response to the national crisis. Morales said he had been called by global leaders, including the presidents of Paraguay, Chile and Spain, as the G7 group of the world’s richest nations announced an aid package to fight Amazon fires. Firefighters from Chile and Argentina as well as France, Spain and Russia were deployed to help fight the flames, according to local media reports. However protesters and the political opposition say Morales’ government needs to declare a state of emergency in the zone in order to allow foreign help in. More than 2,700 fires had been registered by Bolivia’s early warning fire detection agency on Monday, in a swath of flames across the country, from the Amazon north-east to the south-eastern Chaco biome. “It’s not a coincidence that less than a month ago the president declared a law which permitted slash and burn farming practices,” said Adriana Rico, a Bolivian biologist. Known in Bolivia as chaqueo, slash-and-burn is often practiced by migrant small farmers as a cheap and easy way to clear land, she added. Blazes haves destroyed part of the Chiquitano forest, the Amazon and Bolivia’s Pantanal region which it shares with Brazil and Paraguay. “It’s very sad for we indigenous peoples, we’ve lost our means of survival,” said Adolfo Chávez, the former president of the Bolivian indigenous confederation CIDOB. He said Morales had turned his back on indigenous peoples by allowing the destruction of their habitat for the advance of agribusiness. Last week, the pan-Amazon indigenous organisation COICA accused Morales, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, of “gutting every environmental and social strategy to strengthen environmental governance of the Amazon”. It declared the two governments as not welcome in the Amazon and held them personally accountable for the “cultural and environmental genocide” in the world’s largest wilderness. “This month’s devastating fires are the all-too-predictable consequence of the Morales government’s decree authorising new land claims on cleared land”, said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropology professor at Vanderbilt University."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 22.35 BST Donald Trump has reacted angrily to what he called “false and nasty” rumors that his Miami golf club – the same club he is enthusiastically promoting as the location for the next G7 meeting of global leaders – has a problem with bloodsucking bedbugs. “No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!,” Trump tweeted. The rumors appear to stem from a 2016 lawsuit alleging bedbug infestation at the Trump National Doral brought by the New Jersey insurance executive Eric Linder, 63. Linder claimed in court papers that he woke at the resort’s $300-a-night Jack Nicklaus-themed villa to discover, the complaint said, “welts, lumps and marks over much of his face, neck, arms and torso.” Photographs appeared to back up Linder’s claim. Doral’s management hit back, claiming Linder “conducted himself so carelessly and negligently that his conduct was the sole proximate cause or contributing cause” for the insects’ attack. The club reportedly settled the lawsuit. Reports about the case resurfaced on social media Monday after Trump touted the resort’s charms at the G-7 summit in France. But by Monday night, the hashtag “#TrumpBedBugs” was trending on Twitter. The bedbug controversy did not discourage Trump from promoting his property for the next G7 even in an apparent violation of rules against profiteering from the presidency. But the president claimed he won’t profit off the event. “In my opinion I’m not going to make any money,” Trump said. “I don’t want to make money. I don’t care about making money.” The president also claimed aides had toured the country in search of a more suitable location and come up empty. “They went to places all over the country and they came back and said, ‘This is where we’d like to be,’ ” Trump said. Trump’s resort is reported to be struggling, reports the Miami Herald, and members who resigned their membership after Trump won the presidency claim they are waiting to get their deposits back. But one piece of good news: the property, for which Trump reported income of $76m in 2018, up from $75m in 2017, has not been officially cited for bedbug violations."

Sally Weale Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.28 BST


Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 01.05 BST A raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the Guardian. The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked “Official-Sensitive”, details policy proposals for schools in England designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in an attempt to seize the initiative on education before a possible autumn election. While proposals including a £3.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers’ basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to improve behaviour. The paper, which is under discussion between Gavin Williamson’s Department for Education (DfE) and No 10, is understood to have been inserted into the government “grid” of announcements, as families prepare for the new school year in England. The headline figures include £2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including £800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The details for an extra £800m for sixth form and further education colleges are still under discussion with the Treasury. The main proposals in the package include: Increasing pay for teachers, with starting salaries rising to £30,000 by 2022. Encouraging school leaders to confiscate or ban mobile phones. Backing headteachers to exclude pupils, with new guidance on behaviour. Offering academy trusts £24,000 incentives to take over struggling schools. Opening a new wave of free schools, including alternative provision schools for excluded children. Removing exemptions from regular inspection for schools rated as “outstanding” by Ofsted. A fresh push to convert local authority maintained schools to academy status. Any additional funding is likely to be welcomed by school leaders, although many will want to wait until they see how much of the headline figure has been “reprioritised” from the DfE’s previous spending commitments. Last year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated per pupil funding had been cut by 4% in real terms since 2015, after a freeze was imposed by the government. It estimated returning school funding to 2015 levels would require nearly £2bn. Aside from funding, the DfE paper includes a major focus on poor behaviour in schools, said to be driven by No 10’s view that recent polling has shown strong public support for policies taking a tougher line. The announcements will include explicit support for headteachers who use “reasonable force” in their efforts to improve discipline. “This government backs headteachers to improve behaviour and will support them to create safe and disciplined school environments,” the document states. “We will back heads to use powers to promote good behaviour including sanctions and rewards; using reasonable force; to search and confiscate items from pupils (including mobile phones); impose same-day detentions; suspend and expel pupils; ban mobile phones.” While the DfE expects members of the public will welcome “a harder narrative on discipline”, the document warns key stakeholders will be worried the policy could result in increased rates of permanent exclusion, which have in any case been climbing since 2012. The document notes police and crime commissioners “worry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime” and acknowledges concerns it will impact disproportionately on children from some ethnic minority backgrounds, in particular black Caribbean boys, and those with special educational needs (SEN). The success of the Michaela free school in GCSE results last week is likely to be used by ministers to promote its behaviour policies, while four “behaviour tsars” are to be named, including Charlie Taylor, the former head of a school for children with SEN and the current chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. While recent coverage of school funding cuts has included widespread reporting about teaching assistants being axed and headteachers’ concerns about the detrimental impact on classrooms, the briefing paper reveals – on the contrary – that Downing Street and the Treasury are more concerned there may be too many TAs rather than too few. “No 10 and HMT [the Treasury] have been keen to publicly express concerns about the rising number of TAs and set out government’s commitment to more effective deployment of TAs being integral to more efficient use of school spend,” it states. The document advises against going public with this line, warning “it would undermine the ‘hearts and minds’ aspect of the announcement with the numerous audiences we know value TAs – parents, teachers, heads and [the] SEND lobby. This needs to be handled very sensitively if we are to protect the positivity of the announcement.” The Treasury “firmly” rejected a radical attempt to improve recruitment by making teacher training courses free for students. But it appears more enthusiastic about a scheme to reimburse trainee teachers for their student loans. A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures. The prime minister has made clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and make real terms increases to education funding. We will be announcing more details in due course.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 23.30 BST One of the four cornerstones of Boris Johnson’s package of changes is a three-year drive to improve behaviour in schools across England. The bare bones of this policy were sketched out by the previous education secretary, Damian Hinds, in his address to the Conservative party conference last year, but here the tone has shifted significantly, particularly with the inclusion of the phrase “use of reasonable force”. Advice for headteachers, staff and governing bodies on legitimate use of reasonable force already exists, but it is a phrase rarely used in the context of mainstream schools and will be seen as a significant reinforcement of headteachers’ authority. The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has long warned about the detrimental effect of poor pupil behaviour on standards and attainment, and discipline is a favourite among politicians as it plays well with voters. Schools such as the Michaela community school in Wembley, north-west London, which last week celebrated its first set of GCSE results, have impressed ministers with their strict codes of discipline. But the backdrop to the new behaviour policy is mounting disquiet about the effect of strict disciplinary codes on exclusion rates, and the impact of authoritarian behaviour regimes on vulnerable children. With the number of permanent exclusions the highest in nearly a decade, the leaked document is right to anticipate what it calls “potential tensions” surrounding its changes on behaviour. It suggests further discussions in coming weeks about the tone and substance of exclusions policy “so we can consider stakeholder handling more fully”. The academies and free schools policy, which seems to have been adrift in recent months, would be given a significant shot in the arm under the proposals. If teachers and parents were unclear about the government’s direction of travel after a U-turn by the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, over plans to force all schools to become academies in 2016, the leaked document signals a fresh commitment to academies and free schools. While the majority of secondary schools have already converted to academies, taking them out of local authority control and into multi-academy trusts, the rate of conversion has slowed. Primary schools are proving particularly resistant. In recent months, a number of high-profile campaigns have taken hold around the country, in which parents have fought the plans, including at Waltham Holy Cross primary school in Essex. According to the leaked document, the government plans to give more money to successful academy trusts to help them expand, offering incentives to encourage them to mop up challenging schools. It also hopes to build on what the document describes as “the existing success and momentum of the free school programme”. It is perhaps no surprise to see renewed interest in free schools from the government. Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was closely involved when the policy was first rolled out during Michael Gove’s time at the Department for Education (DfE). The free schools policy has been criticised by Labour as an expensive vanity project. The multibillion-pound increase in education funding for England will be the cornerstone of the “back to school” announcements planned by the government, with the key question being how much will make its way into headteachers’ budgets in 2020-21. Assuming the Treasury does not change its mind, the DfE will have raised the nearly £2bn needed to reverse the real-term cuts in funding that schools in England have endured since 2015. Those cuts began to bleed Conservative votes in 2017, and since then the campaigning by unions, parents and others such as the Worth Less? group of school leaders has become even more effective, reinforced by the drip-drip of negative stories about parents being asked to buy items such as glue sticks. The new funds would also put the government on target to meet Johnson’s pledge to raise per-pupil minimum funding to £4,000 at primary schools and £5,000 at secondary schools. It would allow the new national funding formula to begin without penalising schools in big cities while improving funding in Tory shire areas. The package is also said to include £800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), a group that has suffered enormously in terms of funding since 2014, made worse by the cuts local authorities have also experienced in the same period. Meanwhile, the DfE is battling the Treasury for £800m for further education and sixth-form colleges, which would be a genuine boost for the sector and even bear out the government’s boast of “beating Germany at technical education”. Teachers in England may not have felt much love from the government in recent years, but the package of policies being announced within the next few weeks is likely to warm the relationship. A bold proposal to raise starting salaries to £30,000 – up from about £25,000 – by 2022 could help, thrusting the career into the top level of graduate labour market earnings. And the improved school funding is said to include provision for an average 3% pay rise for 2020-21, assuming the independent pay review body agrees. The DfE’s briefing note says the increases would significantly raise early career pay, “with the aim of addressing our pressing recruitment and early career retention challenges and raise the quality of entrants”. Hinds had made teacher recruitment and retention a top priority and the new package largely builds on that, with new policies on flexible working also to be included, plus the key ingredient of more money that had been denied to Hinds. There are also to be revisions to improve initial teacher training, “swapping workload-inducing practices for evidence-based approaches” including behaviour management techniques and evidence from cognitive science about how children develop. Sadly, the proposals are missing one radical move to improve teacher recruitment: a plan for free teacher training without tuition fees, including PGCE courses for secondary school subjects, rejected by the Treasury because of cost.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.15 BST Three schools in Ireland will make history this week by becoming the first to abandon their Catholic ethos and become multi-denominational state-run schools. The transfer in patronage reflects an ebbing of the Catholic church’s dominance in education – it runs about 90% of primary schools – and efforts by small rural schools to attract more pupils to avoid closure. The three small primary schools – Lecarrow in County Roscommon, and Tahilla national school and Scoil an Ghleanna, both in County Kerry – will reopen for the new term on Thursday under the umbrella of local education and training boards. They will offer a multi-belief and values programme rather than Catholic instruction. Preparation for the sacraments of communion and confirmation will take place outside school hours. The schools hope to retain and draw pupils from Ireland’s growing number of atheists, agnostics and non-Catholics. Lecarrow and Tahilla national school have just eight pupils each. Scoil an Ghleanna has 14. “We had a third of our pupils who were non-religious, so we had to look at this,” Sorcha Ni Chatháin, the principal of Scoil an Ghleanna, told RTÉ News. “We needed to look at how we were going to keep pupils, and entice others. We are a beautiful school in the most stunning location, and now we can show – formally, on paper – that we are all inclusive.” Teachers, parents andCatholic clerics endorsed the transition as essential for survival. “This is what the community wanted and I was happy to facilitate that process,” said Fr Patsy Lynch,the parish priest. Under the education and training board structures, the schools will gain more state help for staffing, IT and building maintenance. The Catholic church has previously transferred unused school buildings to multi-denominational patronage but this is said to be the first “live” transfer. A wave of social liberalisation – same-sex marriage, abortion services, a gay prime minister – has swept over Ireland’s conservative Catholic tradition at the same time that sexual abuse scandals engulfed the Catholic church. Attendance at Catholic services has declined. An influx of immigrants – 17% of the population were born abroad – has swelled the number of non-Catholics. The initiative by the three schools reflects a desire to stem decline in rural areas, where closed schools are a common sight. The closure of post offices, banks, police stations and pubs in villages and small towns has prompted warnings of a crisis in rural Ireland. "

Ismail Ajjawi, who lives in Lebanon, said that an officer also asked him about his religion during eight hours of questioning Friday at Logan international airport, according to an account he provided to the campus newspaper, the Harvard Crimson. After five hours of searching his phone and laptop, Ajjawi said that an officer called him into a room and “started screaming at me” “She said that she found people posting political points of view that oppose the US on my friend(s’) list,” he said in the statement to the Crimson. The 17-year-old said that he protested that the comments came from friends and that he never posted his own political views but said his visa was nonetheless canceled and he was sent home. The US Customs and Border Protection agency confirmed that it refused entry to Ajjawi but said it could not provide specific information due to reasons of privacy and law enforcement. “This individual was deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection,” said Michael McCarthy, a spokesman for the agency. A state department official said he could not legally discuss details of the case but added: “Generally US law does not authorize the refusal of visas based solely on political statements or views if those statements or views would be lawful in the United States.” Ajjawi said he hoped to resolve his case in time to start classes next week at Harvard, one of the world’s most prestigious universities, the Harvard Crimson said. Donald Trump has made a tough line on immigration a signature issue, with his administration deciding to monitor the social media use of all visitors as well as legal immigrants. The move has prompted strong criticism from civil liberties advocates, who note that the US constitution’s first amendment guarantees freedom of speech."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.55 BST The compact, gnarled and knobbly specimen looks like a root of ginger. In fact, it’s 17,000-year-old puma poo, and it contains the oldest parasite DNA yet recorded. The team of researchers behind the discovery say the finding not only confirms that the felines were prowling around the Andes towards the end of the last ice age, but reveals that they were infested with roundworm long before humans and their animals turned up. “The common interpretation that the presence of [this roundworm parasite] in modern American wild carnivores is a consequence of their contact with domestic dogs or cats should no longer be assumed as the only possible explanation,” the scientists write. The study, published in the journal Parasitology, reveals how the ancient faeces, or coprolite, was discovered in a sedimentary layer within a rock shelter 3,582m above sea level in Argentina’s Catamarca province. The rock shelter had also been home to a number of other creatures. “Puma, ancient horses, camelids and giant sloths lived together during the Pleistocene,” Dr Romina Petrigh, from Argentina’s National Council of Scientific and Technical Research and first author of the research, told the Guardian. The faeces was radiocarbon-dated to between 16,570 and 17,000 years ago – towards the end of the last ice age. Importantly, the team noted, the coprolite was produced long before humans arrived in the area about 11,000 years ago. After rehydrating and sieving the coprolite the researchers managed to pick out parasite eggs and, from these, isolated ancient DNA. Since DNA becomes damaged and breaks down over time, the team focused on DNA from the tiny “powerhouses” inside cells, called mitochondria. This DNA is shorter and more abundant than nuclear DNA which makes up chromosomes. The team reported that the size and shape of the eggs suggested they came from a parasite called Toxascaris leonina – a type of roundworm which still infests animals today – with the identification backed up by the DNA analysis. Judging by the rounded ends of the faeces and its maximum diameter of just over 2.5cm, the team deduced the afflicted animal was probably a large member of the cat or dog family. Further ancient DNA analysis, this time looking at mitochondrial DNA found in the faeces, revealed that the animal was a puma – a large wild cat still found in the region. The researchers added that the cool temperatures inside the rock shelter, high salt concentrations and rapid drying of the poo might have helped to preserve the DNA within it. Petrigh noted that the latest study sets a new maximum age for the recovery of ancient DNA from coprolites. Dr Piers Mitchell, the director of the ancient parasites laboratory at the University of Cambridge, said the age and preservation of the faeces were remarkable. “The research shows that if the coprolite is preserved in the right environment, we can detect eggs and DNA from parasites many thousands of years old,” he added. “This will make it easier to plot how different types of parasites are evolving over time.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.05 BST A group of metal detectorists have been taken to hospital after eating cake reportedly infused with cannabis at an event in South Yorkshire. Fifteen people were taken ill at the Coil to the Soil national metal detecting event in Doncaster on Saturday. Yorkshire ambulance service said it had received an emergency call just before 6.30pm reporting that people had become ill after “ingesting an unknown substance”. Eight ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, two doctors, two clinical supervisors and a hazardous area response team were dispatched to the scene. “Fifteen patients were treated by ambulance service staff on scene and 13 of those were conveyed to hospitals in South Yorkshire for further care,” the ambulance service said. South Yorkshire police said an investigation was under way and that a woman had been arrested. They said the men and women who were hospitalised had all since been discharged. “A 48-year-old woman from County Durham was arrested in connection to the incident and has since been bailed whilst enquiries continue,” said a police statement. Julian Evan-Hart, the editor of Treasure Hunting magazine, wrote on Facebook that the cake had been “spiked”, which he described as “inconsiderate, irresponsible, stupid and foolish”. “This isn’t a poor reflection on our hobby, the dig organisers or anyone else involved in the planning of the event. It’s just a case of random lunacy.” He later posted: “I have heard all affected are now well again and that is the only thing that is now important. So after learning from this event, ladies and gents, it’s back to the crunch of stubble, sun cream, and making a colossal contribution to our heritage.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/27/canadian-couple-missing-for-weeks-died-in-car-crash-close-to-their-home,"Police had widened search for James Evans, 23, and Easha Rayel, 36, until discovery of car hidden in ditch on highway Leyland Cecco in Toronto Tue 27 Aug 2019 08.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 20.11 BST For two long, devastating weeks, the families of a missing Canadian couple clung to every lead, desperately hoping that the smallest shred of evidence could help explain the sudden disappearance of their loved ones. James Evans, 23, and Easha Rayel, 36, were last seen travelling together near their home on Vancouver Island on Canada’s west coast. But on Sunday, after weeks of waiting and a series of cold tips, families were told that Evans and Rayel had never left the island. Instead, the couple had died in a car accident along a busy highway, and their vehicle was obscured from view beneath thick overgrowth. A resident out dog-walking spotted the couple’s car in a ditch alongside the Pat Bay highway on 24 August, police told the Guardian. “People see the ditch, but they often don’t realize how steep it is,” said constable Meighan de Pass, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Based on the evidence located at the scene of the crash, police believe the two bodies are those of Evans and Rayel, but are awaiting the results of post mortem to confirm the identity of the victims, said de Pass. News that the couple had died along a busy highway, unnoticed for weeks, was a disturbing conclusion to the search, Alastair Evans, James’ father, told CTV News. “I don’t think [the police] are too impressed that they drive by it every day and, you know, it took them two weeks to figure it out,” he said. The discovery of their vehicle also helped explain why the couple suddenly vanished. Reported missing on 9 August, their disappearance was described as “out of character” in police a news release. In the subsequent weeks, the search area widened: police confirmed the couple had been spotted near Vernon, British Columbia, more than 500km from their home. But the grim discovery on Saturday suggests the two never ventured far from home. “They weren’t going to Vancouver. They weren’t going to Vernon. They weren’t going anywhere. They were going back to the house. And who knows? Front tire popped on the car – or deer. It happened pretty quick,” said Evans. “I know that they’ve been working together and falling in love and enjoying life. It wasn’t meant to happen like this.” Police are still actively investigating the cause of the crash but have ruled out any criminal acts, said de Pass. “It definitely was a disappointing end to this.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/26/athens-police-poised-to-evict-refugees-from-squatted-housing-projects,"The central Athens neighbourhood of Exarcheia, which has helped house refugees, is in the crosshairs of a government crackdown Latest: Police raid Athens squats and arrest migrants – report Alex King and Ioanna Manoussaki-Adamopoulou Mon 26 Aug 2019 07.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 11.04 BST It’s just after 5am in the central Athens neighbourhood of Exarcheia. A group of Afghans and Iranians are sitting down together for breakfast in the middle of the street, with a banner that reads “No Pasaran” (“They shall not pass”) strung between the buildings above their heads. They laugh and joke as they help themselves to bread and cheese pies from the communal table. The public breakfast is outside Notara 26, a self-organised refugee accommodation squat. Since opening in September 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, it has provided shelter to over 9,000 people. These ‘‘Breakfasts of Resistance” – held in the early hours when police-led evictions are most likely – have become daily events since Greece’s New Democracy government assumed office in July. [The squat] is important for me because I feel a little more human. We have space to sleep, neighbours and a neighbourhood around us A promise to “restore law and order” was one of the campaign themes that swept the right-wing party to power. Swiftly making good on this, on 8 August plans to evict all 23 refugee and anarchist squats in Exarcheia were announced. If carried out, by the end of the month they will have put an end to Athens’ experiment with autonomous urban governance and its grassroots refugee solidarity network, which currently houses over 1,000 people. Ringed by university buildings, Exarcheia has long been the home of Greece’s intellectual left, antiauthoritarian and anarchist movements. Passing the squads of riot police who stand constant guard on Exarcheia’s perimeter underlines that this is not a typical neighbourhood. It is the site of regular skirmishes between teargas-wielding police and molotov-cocktail hurling youths who are eager to vent their frustration at Greece’s dire economic and political situation. Yet, in a country where far-right and state violence against migrants is well-documented, the lack of visible police presence inside Exarcheia and its vocal antiracist stance have created a place of relative sanctuary. “I am so happy here, I feel safe,” explains Sana*, a squat resident from Afghanistan. “Here we work together and have a good life.” Thousands of refugees arrived in Athens in summer 2015. Seeing little response from the state, the anarchist squat movement in the area (which dates back to the 1980s) resolved to open empty buildings in Exarcheia to house refugees. Notara 26 was the first, and was soon joined by others, founded on the same principles of autonomous self-organisation. The squats offer a viable alternative to official refugee camps, hotspots and detention centres, whose conditions have been widely condemned by international observers. “I visited the camps as a volunteer,” explains Saif*, a 31-year-old recognised refugee from Gaza who lives in a squat. “You’re not a refugee there, you feel like you are in prison – and they’re full. [The squat] is important for me because I feel more like home, I feel a little more human. We have space to sleep, neighbours and a neighbourhood around us.” In opposition, New Democracy attacked the Syriza administration’s handling of the refugee crisis, capitalising on security fears and frustration at Greece having to shoulder a disproportionate share of responsibility. In government, they have stepped up border enforcement,have for the moment revoked asylum seekers’ rights to access health and social security services, and dissolved the ministry of migration, transferring responsibility for refugees to the ministry of citizen protection, which also oversees the police. However, it was under Syriza that the strategy of criminalising the refugee squats began. A wave of evictions by heavily armed police occurred in early April affecting over 300 people. Most squats in Exarcheia operate under a no drugs/no alcohol policy. Yet, timed simultaneously with nearby anti-drug operations, most media reports connected the squat evictions with drug dealing. Where are they going to relocate all the refugee children and families? The camps are full Promising to “clean up Exarcheia,” New Democracy’s rhetoric has conflated drug dealers, criminals, anarchists and migrants. One of the government’s first actions was the controversial repeal of the academic sanctuary law, which incoming prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis claimed made campuses crime hotspots and no-go zones for police. Critics saw the move as an attack on political liberties and Exarchia, rather than on crime. Drug dealers and criminal gangs have exploited the lack of visible law enforcement in Exarcheia. Local activists have made many attempts to improve the situation around the square, such as planting trees, organising screenings and concerts, and making night patrols, but many acknowledge the situation has deteriorated in recent months. Together with the squat evictions and anti-drug operations, authorities have announced plans that include repainting graffiti-covered areas and improving street lighting – none of which require evictions, activists argue. The Hellenic Police refused to comment on specific operations. Despite ongoing threats, no evictions have yet occurred this summer. However, there has been a noticeable escalation of police activity in the area, with almost daily operations on and around the square. Those arrested for immigration violations have been taken into detention. New Democracy have announced they will start deporting failed asylum applicants. “They have used criminality, prejudice towards refugees and even accusations of terrorism to discredit the left resistance in Exarcheia,” says Panos*, an activist who helped open Notara 26 back in 2015. “Personally, I don’t think they will be successful. The political cost will be great and where are they going to relocate all the refugee children and families? The camps are full.’’ Athens has emptied for the summer. Shops are closed and it feels like a hot and sticky ghost town. But on Exarcheia Square, there is a palpable air of tension, as those gathered know another police operation could occur at any moment. Around the corner, the boarded-up Azadi squat, empty since the April evictions, has been covered with a mural depicting anarchists facing off against riot police and the slogan: “Exarcheia will win.” Time will tell. *Names of interviewees have been changed to protect their identities.

Last modified on Tue 20 Aug 2019 23.19 BST Between record heat and rain, this summer’s weather patterns have indicated, once again, that the climate is changing. US cities, where more than 80% of the nation’s population lives, are disproportionately hit by these changes, not only because of their huge populations but because of their existing – often inadequate – infrastructure. Maybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable In urban areas, heatwaves are exacerbated by vehicles, industrial processes and the presence of heat-retaining concrete and asphalt. And it is in cities – especially in low-lying poorer areas – where record rainfall often accumulates. “People are coming into urban areas and they cannot be stopped,” says Chandana Mitra, an associate professor of geosciences at Auburn University, who studies the impact of heat on cities. Mitra has experienced the impact of climate change in her hometown of Kolkata, India, and is now observing it in Auburn, Alabama, and nearby Birmingham. “Everyone aspires to be in an urban area and there is chaos.” While the impacts of climate change are fundamentally local, experts say heat is one of the most concerning, especially in cities. “From a disaster perspective, [heat] is invisible,” says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance. Mitra likens the problem to having a finger in a pan of water while someone gradually turns up the heat. “Maybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable. There could be a tipping point of no return.” Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. It’s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time. This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities. Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US A study by the University of Maryland published this year predicts that by 2080, Denver will be as hot and wet as Borger, Texas, about 50 miles (80km) north of Amarillo; Philadelphia will feel warmer and drier – more like Memphis, Tennessee, and New York City will be up to 9F (5C) warmer, with a climate similar to Jonesboro, Arkansas. The study, which accompanies a tool that allows US users to find what their city will be like by 2080, shows that if emissions continue at the current pace residents in cities around the nation will: • Experience an average temperature increase of 8.2F (4.5C) • Live in climates similar to the current climates of cities 528 miles (850kms) south of their hometowns Increasing heat, either now or in the future, is an issue cities are beginning to understand better, says Shickman who started the Global Cool Cities Alliance in 2011. Since that time, there’s been a huge increase in awareness of heat and urban heat islands, he says. “The issue now is, ‘OK, this is a uniquely challenging problem, and how do we develop policy and implement solutions’.” With a string of subsequent record hot years and increasing flooding, cities are already dealing with the impacts of a changing climate: Deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 658 people die every year from heat-related causes. From 1999 to 2010, 8,081 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States and occurred more commonly among older, younger and poorer populations. Urban heat islands retain heat overnight, preventing people from sleeping well and leading to even more health problems, says Lucy Hutyra, an associate professor of earth and environment at Boston University. Air pollution is often worst on hot days, and when people leave windows open for air flow, the quality of the air can cause respiratory problems. Warmer, moister conditions also mean that heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding is on the rise; so far this year 78 people have died as a result, according to the National Weather Service. Power outages. As experienced by New Yorkers this year, excessive heat in conjunction with excess demand for electricity for air conditioning can cause the grid – or portions of it – to fail. “Energy demand is going to go up,” says Shickman. “It’s a substantial and nonlinear reaction. Our grid is going to be taxed in ways I don’t think we are prepared for.” Shickman says that going from an 80F day to a 90F day would require an additional 20-25% power. Going to 95F requires almost 40% more power. Excess heat can also evaporate water needed to cool power plants, forcing some out of commission. Infrastructure failures. In addition to electricity grid problems, asphalt can melt in excess temperatures; rail tracks expand; and can even affect airports – currently some airplanes can’t take off from Phoenix airport, for example, when the temperature exceeds 118F because the air is too thin. Heat is a problem for all areas of city governance, said Shickman. “If you ask any sort of department head what is your biggest challenge, heat is probably not number one, but I guarantee you it’s somewhere between number two and number five.” But, he says, unfortunately there are no “heat czars” to manage the issue. Flooding, too, can wreak havoc on a city’s infrastructure, from blowing out bridges and roads to inundating water treatment plants. Economic Impact. According to a 2018 study by Texas A&M University: “The growing number of extreme rainfall events that produce intense precipitation are resulting in –and will continue to result in – increased urban flooding unless steps are taken to mitigate their impacts.” The 2017 National Climate Assessment concluded: “Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades …[and that] … increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.” Between 2007 and 2011 alone, urban flooding in Cook County, Illinois, resulted in over 176,000 claims or flood losses at a cost of $660m (£545m). Becoming aware of the threat of heat and other climate changes is one thing. But doing something about it is difficult with limited budgets and multiple priorities, and “there is no one solution,” says Shickman. With that in mind, here are some of the ways cities are addressing heat and extreme precipitation. Communication. In New York City, home health aides are being trained to recognize the signs of heat stress with their clients. In Auburn and Birmingham, Mitra talks to churches, service groups and individuals about urban heat islands, individual carbon footprints and solutions. One of her students is developing an app around the issue, while another group is working on an Alabama specific YouTube channel to communicate about climate breakdown-related problems and solutions. “Many people in Alabama have yet to realize the rate at which things have been changing,” Mitra says. The Texas A&M study recommends better communication and coordination between federal, state and local agencies to address the problem of urban flooding. Trees, plants and green infrastructure. Trees not only offer shade, but they cool the air by evaporating water. Adding more plants and trees, like New York City has done with its million tree program, can reduce the temperature of a city as well as soak up excess stormwater. Hutyra says such an approach won’t work everywhere – Los Angeles had numerous problems with its one million tree program in part, because of the city’s water scarcity. But areas of the northeast with plenty of water can fill empty tree wells and better develop parks and greenways to mitigate the heat. One of Mitra’s favorite solutions is urban gardens. She points to Atlanta, which is working to develop a seven acre food forest that will also help reduce carbon footprint. Restoring or widening waterways, as is being done with Houston’s Brays Bayou, can provide cooler greenspaces, as well as capacity for excess stormwater. Cool roofs and pavement. “At a minimum all roofs should be white with the exception of solar and green roofs,” says Shickman, whose Global Cool Cities Alliance has launched the One Million Cool Roofs Challenge. White or light colored roofs reflect heat and can lower the overall temperature in a city as well as making individual buildings and homes cooler. According to one study, significant lightening of roofs and pavements could reduce temperatures in Chicago by 2.7F (1.5C). After Louisville, Kentucky, was identified as one of the fastest heating cities, local government began offering rebates for cool roofs in low income communities. San Antonio offers help for low-income residents to replace older roofs with lighter colored shingles and a thermal barrier, providing up to $1,000 per household a year in energy savings, Shickman says. He adds that in terms of infrastructure changes, Los Angeles is leading efforts on cool pavements, testing reflective coating on 17 blocks of the city and helping to refine pavement products. Air conditioning. While the least optimal solution, air conditioning is the most realistic one to beat the heat, says Hutyra. Air conditioning can raise the temperatures within cities through its waste heat and, when powered by fossil fuels, can contribute to the problem of climate change. But Hutyra says a more distributed electricity grid with energy from renewable sources could help alleviate some of those concerns. Cities in the future, Hutyra says, won’t be unliveable, “They just will be different. I think how we play and live and move in cities today isn’t how we did 20 years ago. I think in the face of these large changes in climate coming our way ... I think it will reshape what our cities look like and how we live in them.” Pam Radtke Russell is a senior editor at Engineering News-Record, in New Orleans and a specialist on climate adaptation Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/19/dutch-take-cycling-to-a-new-level-with-worlds-biggest-bike-park,"In the Netherlands, where there are more bikes than people, serious money is being spent encouraging even more people to get on their bikes Senay Boztas in Amsterdam Mon 19 Aug 2019 11.52 BST


First published on Mon 19 Aug 2019 06.00 BST In a nation with more bikes than people, finding a space to park can be a problem. The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world’s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles. The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent. It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage. “We are striving to make it a cyclists’ paradise and there’s still much to be done,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. “I’d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.” She added: “If you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible – and you don’t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.” According to the Dutch Statistics Office, 60% of all trips to work in the Netherlands are made by car and just a quarter by cycling – although in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, (known as the Randstad region) cycling is more common. Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority. “In the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,” said Van Veldhoven. “So investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that’s essential for our national economy moving.” The national railway service NS is investing tens of millions in bike parking, according to its spokesman, Geert Koolen. “We have over 1 million train passengers a day and in our bigger cities – like Utrecht – more than half arrive at the station by bike,” he said. “At Dutch stations there are some 490,000 parking spaces for bikes and we expect 5 million bicycle rides on OV-fiets [shared public transport bikes] in 2020.” Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a “healthy urban living” policy. “We are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,” said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. “Cycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands’ first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world’s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.” The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. “The bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,” said its strategy director, Adam Stones. “If you look at it as transformation – how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment – you put more weight behind it.” But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking – as in central Amsterdam, where “wild” parked bikes are confiscated. “I am not a fan of this,” said its director, Saskia Kluit. “There’s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it’s better they can stop everywhere they want.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

The city in southeast Spain goes without rain for months on end, but when it comes it’s torrential, bringing destructive and sometimes fatal flooding. Or at least, it used to. In San Juan, a low-lying area of the city, authorities have built a new park with a twist. Called La Marjal, it serves as a typical recreation area and a nature reserve – but its primary purpose is to store, and then recycle, rainwater. In function it resembles an aljibe, a technique developed by Arab residents of Spain many centuries ago, in which rainwater is collected and stored in a kind of cistern underneath a building. La Marjal does a similar job, but outdoors. The water is also then diverted to a nearby treatment plant, where it can subsequently be used to clean streets and water parks. “The need for sustainable management has forced us to recover ancestral practices,” says Jorge Olcina, professor of analytical geography at the University of Alicante. “You could say that these rainwater storage facilities in Alicante and Barcelona are the new aljibes of the 21st century.” Over eight centuries, the Arab rulers of Spain became masters of water management and conservation. Much of this knowledge was lost when they were expelled en masse in the early 17th century. The park uses some of the same principles as the aljibe. “When the rainfall is too heavy for the storm drains to cope, the overflow is diverted to the park,” explains Amelia Navarro, director of sustainable development for the Alicante water authority. “It has the capacity of 18 Olympic pools but it’s never reached more than 30%,” she says, not even after its first big in test 2017 when there was unusually heavy rain. The park has been landscaped with native Mediterranean plants and rapidly populated by resident and migratory birds and small creatures, a fitting development given that marjal is the Spanish word for a coastal wetland. Since it opened in 2015, around 90 species of birds have been spotted in the park, an oasis among apartment blocks. “We introduced larvae-eating fish so that we don’t get mosquitoes,” said Navarro, adding that the water is oxygenated to reduce algae growth. When storms break, rising water levels trip an acoustic alarm to warn people to leave. The park is then closed until the rain eases off. La Marjal was built in two years for €3.7 million, a quarter of the cost of the city’s traditional concrete reservoir. It also costs only €50,000 a year to maintain. “We’re the ones who end up running these projects so they have to be affordable,” says Miguel Rodríguez, head of operations at the public-private Aguas de Alicante. “Ultimately, the public pays so we have to keep costs down.” Although the park is a clever and relatively inexpensive solution, Spain’s urban water authorities have been generally slow to adapt to the climate crisis, says Leandro del Moral, professor of human geography at the University of Seville. Only Madrid, Cádiz and Seville have made any significant progress, he says. The country’s water plans, announced every five years, now predict that 10-15% less water will be available in the near future, as higher temperatures brought on by global heating mean more water is lost through evaporation and plant respiration. “Even if it rains as much as before there will be less water,” says Del Moral. “This is a clear message that climate change is having an impact. Cities need to anticipate, not react to, the increased risk of drought.” “We need new infrastructures, which are very expensive,” says Francisco Bartual, managing director of Aguas de Alicante. “We have upgraded the water network to the point that it’s operating at around 90%, which means we’re letting very little water go to waste.” But water is a scarce resource and political interests often trump environmental ones. Although agriculture accounts for only 3% of GDP, it takes up 80% of water consumption – and farmers are a major voting bloc. Water gets diverted from wet regions to dry, and Spain’s few major rivers are interrupted by hundreds of dams, all of which impacts the big cities. “Agriculture has to reduce water consumption when there is danger of drought, not when it has already arrived, when it is too late,” says Del Moral. “But this is a political hot potato.” Storing and recycling water, as La Marjal was designed to do, are rising up the list of alternatives.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.09 BST Changchun, the capital of China’s north-eastern Jilin province, has a name that translates to “long spring”. According to folklore, the name was bestowed by an emperor in recognition of its temperate summer. So mild and pleasant was the city at that time of year that it felt as though spring could stretch on endlessly, without ever morphing into the sticky humidity that beset the rest of the country. It’s easy to imagine idyllic summers there and Lulu Wang recalls her own with glee. “My grandmother had a house with a garden where we would catch dragonflies in the yard,” she says. “It was sort of the iconic childhood.” The Farewell – Wang’s second feature film after the 2014 art-world satire Posthumous – is also set in Changchun, but here it’s foreign and alienating, as if the city of her memories was merely imagined. Like all of China, it’s modernising at breakneck speed. “Every time I go back, it’s a completely different place, and all the things I once knew are gone,” she says. This sense of absence permeates the film, which is based on Wang’s own life. Taken literally: absence in the form of grief, as Billi – a Chinese-born, US-raised writer who serves as Wang’s onscreen proxy – returns to Changchun to see her nai nai (Mandarin for grandmother) one last time. Nai Nai is dying, but doesn’t know; in keeping with traditional values of collective over individual suffering, the family keeps her in the dark about her stage-four cancer diagnosis, orchestrating a last-minute wedding as a guise under which everyone reunites. Billi is reluctant to lie but acquiesces – she has no choice when it seems so natural to her relatives. I had no idea if it would resonate, because it’s such a specific and personal story Absence manifests in other shapes, too. Billi grieves not just for Nai Nai but also for a loss of cultural identity. “In addition to saying goodbye to grandma, there’s this feeling of sand slipping through your fingers, of being unable to hold on to past memories and feelings – unable to find anything concrete that represents home,” Wang says. It’s a trauma instantly recognisable to anydiaspora – the feeling of suspension between two cultures, and the knowledge that to fully embrace one is to sacrifice the other. “I think people have this romanticism of the homeland, and that’s just not the reality for me,” Wang says. “Every time I go back to China, I feel more American than ever, so it’s this question of, ‘Well, where is home?’ We’re always searching for it and never fully fitting in.” Initial talks with production studios only furthered Wang’s sense of displacement. In the US, producers pushed for a comedy of errors, something more marketable than The Farewell’s heady, unsolvable mix of emotions. Meanwhile, Chinese executives couldn’t understand why Billi – and by extension, Wang – felt so conflicted. They wanted a heroine who was less “westernised”, who wasn’t afflicted by such guilt. “Both sides were looking at it in a binary way, where it’s east versus west,” Wang sats. “Versus, as opposed to finding the bridge between the two, or the space in between to be able to navigate both.” The Farewell feels unique because of its unwillingness to lose either half of its identity. Billi is American, as is Wang, but the film’s dialogue is almost entirely in Mandarin, spoken by an all-east Asian primary cast. It panders to neither US moviegoers nor Chinese audiences, yet it’s become one of this year’s biggest success stories, splintering even Marvel’s stronghold at the US box office. If Crazy Rich Asians proved to studio executives the commercial potential of east Asian narratives, The Farewell is testament to their staying power. Did Wang expect it to be so universally loved? “I certainly hoped it would be, but I had no idea if it would resonate, because it’s such a specific and personal story,” she says. “It’s so much easier to tell a fish-out-of-water story when the person is blond and blue-eyed going to an Asian country, for example. But what is it like when you look the same as those people, and you’re expected to fit in? How do you put that interiority on screen?” In that respect, The Farewell speaks for itself. It’s certainly helped by Awkwafina’s performance – nuanced and restrained, without leaning into the kind of sentiment that seems so easy in a character experiencing grief. Last year’s fast-talking breakout roles in Ocean’s 8 and Crazy Rich Asians are stripped away, and in their place is a more introverted Awkwafina, who expresses as much through physicality as words. “She hunched over as soon as we got back to China,” Wang says of her star. “At first, I had no idea why she was doing it; it looked so bad. But it really worked for the character, because she feels small. She doesn’t know her role in China, she’s not allowed to express her voice. She feels the weight on her shoulders of her family and her culture.” Awkwafina’s Billi is relatable but she’s not an everywoman. Resisting cliched characterisation, Wang fought to centre her own perspective without justifying or explaining it, even if that risked alienating audiences. “It goes back to that saying: approach everything with the audacity of a mediocre white man,” she says, laughing. “I had to take on that audacity of saying, ‘I don’t care if you don’t understand. This is my reality, and I’m going to assume you do.’” In a landscape where diasporic narratives have been sidelined for too long, The Farewell is a watershed for its centring of second-generation immigrants – third-culture kids for whom surface-level representation is no longer enough. “People are always asking me about the importance of representation and identity in relation to making The Farewell and of course those things are really important to me – thinking about my identity and exploring my identity in the west,” Wang says. “But I would love it if men – white men – were also asked the same questions as me. “They should be asked these questions so they can be more conscientious about how they’re representing people, how they’re not representing people, and aware of their own blind spots.” No single film-maker, Wang says, can shoulder the responsibility of representing an entire culture. “It can be dangerous if we’re reductive about it, or if diversity is looked upon as a trend.” • The Farewell opens in Australian cinemas on 5 September and in the UK on 20 September"
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/28/co-op-ethos-thrives-on-scottish-islands-and-cumbria,"Survey emphasises importance of co-operatives in areas of traditional self-reliance Severin Carrell Scotland editor Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.01 BST


Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.13 BST Scotland’s islands have the highest proportion of co-operatives of any part of the UK thanks to a long tradition of self-reliance, a survey has found. The study by Co-operatives UK, the sector’s development body, said its survey of co-ops by local authority area found the Western Isles and Orkney topped the table with 8.16 and 5.91 co-ops respectively per 10,000 people. Shetland came in third, with 5.63. Eden in Cumbria came in joint fourth, with 4.55, followed by nearby Allerdale with 3.6. The Scottish sector’s businesses are generally small, often community shops which provide the only stores in scarcely populated island communities. There are also credit unions, community energy companies and fishing co-ops. The findings have been published as part of Co-operatives UK’s annual economic survey. It put its total turnover UK-wide at £37.7bn for 2018-19, a little over 1% higher than last year’s figure of £37.6bn and 2.75% higher than the £36.3bn in 2016-17. The study confirmed that the John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned group which includes Waitrose food stores, was the UK’s largest co-op with a turnover of £10.3bn; the Co-op itself narrowly behind on £10.2bn. Arla, the Denmark-based diary co-op, came third with a turnover of £2.6bn. Excluding turnover, the data shows a slight decline in the sector’s size overall. The UK had 7,215 co-ops employing more than 233,000 people in the last financial year, compared with 7,226 employing nearly 235,000 a year earlier. The report highlighted the Papay Community Co-operative, which runs the only shop and hostel on Papa Westray. The Orkney island has a resident population of about 85 people but is popular with island-hoppers on holiday. The business is close to Papa Westray’s airport, famous as a departure point for the world’s shortest scheduled service, a two-minute, 1.7-mile (2.8km) flight to nearby Westray. Tim Dodman, the co-op’s secretary, said the business had an annual turnover of about £250,000 and employed four people, with some part-time help during busy periods. It also runs the school bus and local tours. It was founded in 1980 after the only shop closed and no one could be found to run a new one single-handed. “The co-op ethos is very important,” Dodman said. “This is a small island and pretty remote. It’s much better to work cooperatively than have one individual in control of a lifeline service.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/27/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-steps-back-from-possible-trump-talks,"Hassan Rouhani says US must first lift sanctions before summit can take place Associated Press in Tehran Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.29 BST


First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 08.12 BST Iran’s president has back-pedalled on possible talks with Donald Trump, saying the US president must first lift sanctions imposed on Tehran, otherwise a meeting between the two would be a mere photo op. Hassan Rouhani’s change of heart came a day after Trump said there was a “really good chance” the two could meet after a surprise intervention by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, during the G7 summit to try to bring Washington and Tehran together. “Without the US’s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,” Rouhani said in a televised speech on Tuesday, adding that Washington “holds the key” to what happens next. “If someone intends to make it as just a photo op with Rouhani, that is not possible,” he said. Earlier on Monday, Rouhani expressed readiness to negotiate a way out of the crisis following America’s pullout from the nuclear deal. “If I knew that going to a meeting and visiting a person would help my country’s development and resolve the problems of the people, I would not miss it,” he had said. “Even if the odds of success are not 90% but are 20% or 10%, we must move ahead with it. We should not miss opportunities.” Rouhani also shielded his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, against criticism from hardliners over his surprise visit to Biarritz on Sunday, where leaders of theG7 rich democracies were meeting. Iran’s English-language Press TV issued a vague, anonymous statement later on Monday, rejecting Macron’s initiative. Macron said he hoped Trump and Rouhani could meet within weeks in hopes of saving the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran struck with world powers, but which the US unilaterally withdrew from last year. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. On Tuesday, Macron acknowledged his efforts to bring Iran and the US together are “fragile” but said he still sees a “possible path” to rapprochement between the two. Inviting Zarif to the G7 summit as a surprise guest was a risky diplomatic manoeuvre but it helped create “the possible conditions of a useful meeting,” Macron said. It’s France’s responsibility to play the “role of a balancing power,” Macron said, adding that his efforts allowed hope for a “de-escalation” of tensions.Since the US pullout from the nuclear deal, Iran has lost billions of dollars in business deals allowed by the accord, as the US re-imposed and escalated sanctions largely blocking Tehran from selling crude abroad, a crucial source of hard currency for the Islamic republic. Rouhani’s U-turn can be seen as a result of pressure from hardliners in the Iranian establishment who oppose taking a softer tone toward the West. But it could also reflect that the model of grand photo opportunity summits in exotic locations, such as Trump’s meetings with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, while stringent sanctions remain in place, does not necessarily appeal to Rouhani, whose signature accomplishment was the nuclear deal, which started unravelling with Trump’s pullout. The hardline Javan daily, which is close to Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard, warned Rouhani in large font on its Tuesday front page: “Mr Rouhani, photo diplomacy will not develop the country.”"

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.01 BST A British energy firm lighting up homes in Africa with pay-as-you-go solar power has secured £40m to extend its reach to Asia with the help of Japan’s Mitsubishi. The conglomerate has taken a stake in off-grid solar company BBOXX through the start-up’s latest funding round, which will power the Africa-focused company deeper into Asia. The funds will also help BBOXX, which operates in Rwanda, Kenya, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to break into new African markets, where an estimated one in three people live without reliable access to electricity. BBOXX is one of a growing number of energy companies to plug into the demand for energy across Africa and south Asia. The falling cost of solar technology and the strength of mobile banking across Africa have encouraged major investments from global energy companies including US giant General Electric and France’s EDF and Engie. Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX’s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi’s “extensive reach” and “technological expertise” would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services. “The funding is further evidence of Japanese interest in Africa and in PAYG [pay as you go] solar energy globally,” he said. BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips. The fixed-period contracts usually run for about two years, until the equipment is paid off. Customers can then choose to keep their existing kit and use the electricity for free, or upgrade their system to include more panels and extra appliances under a new contract. Earlier this year, BBOXX sold a 50% stake in its Togo-based business to EDF Energy in return for funding to help grow the company. It operates about 270,000 solar systems, of which 200,000 are monitored remotely by software that uses machine learning to track customers’ energy use and payments. In time, BBOXX hopes to broaden its reach beyond energy to include gas, water, internet and loans. The company’s largest rival, Fenix International, supplies 500,000 homes and was snapped up by Engie in late 2017. Hamayun said: “We look forward to this next phase of growth that will help us to transform more lives, unlock potential and grow our already global footprint by opening up new markets, and develop our product range.” The funding round also included Bamboo Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based impact investor; DOEN Participaties, a Dutch impact investment fund; and Canadian growth equity firm MacKinnon, Bennett & Company."

00:30 Joe Biden said that racism in the US is a “white man’s problem visited on people of color.” The AP reports: Taking aim at incendiary racial appeals by Trump, Biden said in an interview with a small group of reporters that a president’s words can “appeal to the worst damn instincts of human nature,” just as they can move markets or take a nation into war. ... The former vice president attributed his support among black voters to the fact that he has a long record of working in their communities — something, he said without being specific, that several of his opponents have not done. He added that while he would “preferably” select a woman or person or color as his running mate, he is ultimately looking for someone who is “simpatico with what I stand for and what I want to get done.” He said he will not make a commitment on whom he would choose until he is comfortable that they agree on major issues and how to address them. Biden has had a busy campaign day today. He released a new healthcare ad and commented on Trump’s divisive conduct at the G7 conference even as court documents revealed that his brother James Biden had promised his potential business partners that they would have influence with the former vice president. 12.12am BST

Walsh was temporarily booted off air in 2014 for using racist slurs on his radio show (which he has repeated on Twitter), and had repeatedly stood by his racist descriptions of Haiti and Chicago, saying “Those aren’t racist statements.

23:05 Republican and Democratic senators were denied visas to Russia, amid a debate over whether or not Russia should be readmitted into the Group of Seven. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy and the Republican senator Ron Johnson, both members of the Senate foreign relations committee who have advocated for sanctions against Russia, were denied visas. The Republican senator Mike Lee was the only one of the three senators who planned to visit Russian officials and American businesses in the country who was granted access. “The Russian government is further isolating their country by blocking our visit,” Murphy said in a statement. In a separate statement yesterday, Jonson said: “I had hoped direct dialogue with Russian parliamentarians could help set the stage for better future relations between our two nations. Unfortunately, Russian officials continue to play diplomatic games.” The Russian Embassy in the US responded Johnson didn’t apply for a visa, and accused him of distorting Russian foreign policy in his “usual russophobic manner”.

The California representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, a democrat, posted a letter she wrote last week, to the acting head of the homeland security department. In it, she criticizes the department’s notification to congress detailing the decision “lacks any analysis to demonstrate the movement of funds is justified”.

21:48 Deutsche’s redacted letter came in response to the court’s demand that the bank, as well as Capitol One, reveal whether they had financial documents pertinent to House Democrats’ subpoena. The Democratic lawmakers have been seeking Trump’s tax returns and subpoenaed the two financial institutions, which have had business relationships with the president. Trump, in turn, sued to block the banks from complying with the subpoena. The president is now appealing a district judge’s earlier ruling that the banks should comply with the Democrats’ subpoena. Trump is suing in his capacity as a private citizen, but the Justice Department filed a brief last week in support of his legal effort. Given the original subpoena, Deutsche’s redacted letter almost certainly refers to possessing financial records connected to Trump and his immediate family. 9.33pm BST
21:33 The US attorney general, William Barr, has booked the president’s DC hotel for a holiday party that could direct more than $30,000 to Trump’s business. The Washington Post reports: Barr signed a contract, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, for a ‘Family Holiday Party’ in the hotel’s Presidential Ballroom Dec. 8. The party will feature a buffet and four-hour open bar for about 200 people. Barr is paying for the event himself and chose the venue only after other hotels, including the Willard and the Mayflower were booked, according to a Department of Justice official. The official said the purpose of Barr’s party wasn’t to curry favor with the president. Barr holds the bash annually and it combines holiday festivities and a ‘ceilidh,’ a party featuring Irish or Scottish music. ‘Career ethics officials were consulted and they determined that ethics rules did not prohibit him from hosting his annual party at the Trump hotel,’ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the party is not a Justice Department event. 9.24pm BST
21:24 While Deutsche Bank did acknowledge it has at least some of Trump’s tax returns, Capitol One said it did not. Deutsche Bank appears to have tax returns for President Trump. Capital One Financial does not. It's hardly surprising Deutsche Bank has some of Trump's tax returns. What's shocking to me is the bank was unwilling to answer this basic question until faced with a court order. pic.twitter.com/XGIeUPAnn0 The banks had resisted answering judges’ questions about whether they possessed the returns and were given until this afternoon to address the matter. Deutsche’s acknowledgement will likely only escalate House Democrats’ pressure on the bank to hand over the returns, but Trump is still fighting the lawmakers’ subpoena to obtain his financial records. 9.20pm BST
21:20 Names are redacted in Deutsche Bank’s letter about the tax returns it possesses, but it seems clear that the filing is referencing Trump and his immediate family. Deutsche Bank has all but confirmed the bank is in possession of tax returns for President Trump and some of his immediate family. Names are redacted in the letter the bank just filed in response to Monday's court order, but it's clear who they are referring to. 👉 pic.twitter.com/iYAuNMlGcu The New York Times reported in April that Deutsche Bank had valuable financial information on Trump that House Democrats have sought, including descriptions of the value of his assets and partial tax returns.

21:11 Deutsche Bank and Capitol One have repeatedly refused to tell the court whether they had Trump’s tax returns, claiming that “contractual obligations” prevent them from doing so. An appellate court judge told a Deutsche lawyer last week, “Should we go to court and seek an order? I’m serious. We need to know.” The two banks were then given until today to reveal whether they had the tax returns, but it’s unclear whether Capitol One has done so. Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial have until Tuesday by 4 p.m. to tell the court if they are in possession of any of President Trump's tax returns. If they won't answer they need to explain in detail why. Here's today's court order 👉 pic.twitter.com/emc4xETzQL Updated

20:56 ABC, the network that is hosting the next Democratic debate, is aware of two more qualifying polls being released tomorrow before the Democratic National Committee’s deadline, CNN reports. That means billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who remains one poll short of making the debate stage, will have two final chances to qualify. This is also welcome news for Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who needs two more qualifying polls to participate. But Gabbard would need to register at two percent or more in both polls, which seems unlikely given other recent results. If one or both of them qualifies, ABC will be forced to split the debate into two nights, Sept. 12 and 13. If only the current 10 candidates qualify, the debate will be held on one night, Sept. 12. And the top-polling candidates, not to mention ABC, are hoping the debate remains a one-night event. “Continuing to assign candidates by random draw for the fall debates makes no sense and is a disservice to primary voters,” a Democratic campaign aide told CNN. “They want to see Biden-Warren-Sanders-Harris-Buttigieg. They’ve been the consistent top tier for months now. Why keep pushing that off?” 8.40pm BST
20:40 The Trump administration is pulling hundreds of millions of dollars from the Homeland Security Department, including FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, to pay for immigrant detention space. The news comes as Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria, braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. NBC News reports: To fund temporary locations for court hearings for asylum-seekers along the southern border, ICE would gain $155 million, all from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, according to the letter from Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., which was seen by NBC News. The allocations were sent to Congress as a notification rather than a request, because the administration believes it has the authority to repurpose these funds after Congress did not pass more funding for ICE detention beds as part of an emergency funding bill for the southwest border in June. Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security will lose $116 million previously allocated for Coast Guard operations, aviation security and other components in order to fund nearly 6,800 more beds for immigrant detainees, the officials said. Trump appeared to complain about Puerto Rico needing disaster aid in a tweet earlier today, which misstated the amount of funding the island has received. He has also reportedly complained about alleged mismanagement by Puerto Rican officials, even though his own administration was criticized for its handling of Hurricane Maria. Wow!

20:01 New York Times columnist Bret Stephens has quit Twitter after getting into a spat with a critic regarding his newsroom’s bed bug infestation. The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens. https://t.co/k4qo6QzIBW Luke O’Neil reports: Riffing on the newspaper’s predicament, David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, poked fun at Stephens on Twitter on Monday evening. The post received nine likes and zero retweets. What followed was as close to the perfect Streisand effect as one could imagine. Stephens, who was not tagged in the original post, emailed Karpf, and copied in the provost of the university, in an apparent attempt to get Karpf in trouble. And then it went viral. Karpf shared news of the scolding on Twitter, in a post that has now been retweeted 7,500 times and liked 48,500 (and counting). ... Stephens wrote: ‘I’m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people – people they’ve never met – on Twitter. I think you’ve set a new standard. I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a ‘bedbug’ to my face. That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part.’ ... On Tuesday, Stephens announced he was leaving Twitter. ‘Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt. Thanks to all my followers, but I’m deactivating this account.’ 7.39pm BST
19:39 Democratic presidential candidates who have not yet made the September debate stage will have at least one more chance to secure another qualifying poll. Quinnipiac University plans to release another national poll on the Democratic primary tomorrow, a CNN reporter shared on Twitter. .@QuinnipiacPoll says it will release a national 2020 Democratic poll tomorrow at 8 am, which is likely the final chance for Democratic candidates to make the DNC debate criteria. @TomSteyer needs one more poll to make the cut. Will this be it? Others need more. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer only needs one more poll to qualify, but if this is indeed the last poll before tomorrow’s qualification deadline, it means all the other dozen or so candidates who have not made the stage are officially out of luck. 7.25pm BST
19:25 Dozens of House Democrats have signed on to a letter demanding an investigation into the sweetheart plea deal that the late financier and alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein secured in 2008. Epstein’s victims deserve justice & the public needs to know why a prolific child molester got a slap on the wrist instead of a long prison sentence. Today, we’re requesting a Congressional investigation into #Epstein’s 2008 sweetheart plea deal & recent suicide. pic.twitter.com/7RrKmUUdWl “While we cannot undo the damage Epstein has caused the victims of his abuse, the survivors of Epstein’s exploitation and manipulation deserve a forum to be heard and both they and the public deserve transparency and answers to unresolved questions,” reads the letter, which was signed by 45 Democrats. “Government and law enforcement officials involved [should] be required to explain under oath the highly unusual treatment afforded to Jeffrey Epstein,” they add. Trump’s former labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned last month amid backlash over his role in the plea deal. Acosta was serving as the US attorney in Miami when Epstein secured a non-prosecution agreement despite dozens of abuse allegations. Donald Trump has insisted he is not seeking to profit from the US presidency after revealing a resort he owns in Miami is in the running to host the next G7 summit in 2020."

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.20 BST Primark has announced plans to improve its sustainability credentials by training 160,000 cotton farmers in India, Pakistan and China in environmentally friendly farming methods by 2022. The target is part of the retailer’s sustainable cotton programme, launched in 2013, with the aim to use 100% sustainable cotton in all its product categories. The sustainable cotton is currently being used in women’s pyjamas, a range of denim, towels and bedding, and will be rolled out to menswear and T-shirts next. The announcement will lead to a five-fold increase in the number of farmers enrolled in the programme, operated in partnership with Cotton Connect, which works to increase commercial opportunities with limited impact to people or the environment, and the Self Employed Women’s Association trade union. The methods being taught include efficient irrigation, planting in rows with trenches to maximise drainage, and introducing organic pesticides and fertilisers such as cow dung, when possible, to reduce the use of chemical options. Defending the use of fertilisers and pesticides on the crops, Primark’s ethical trade and environment sustainability director, Katharine Stewart, said the retailer has “taken the view that we’re going to do as much as possible to minimise it [the use of fertilisers and pesticides on crops], but equally what we don’t want is for the farmers not to be able to deal with some of the pests when they have them”. Stewart said completely organic farming “means a much lower yield”, which would affect the livelihoods of farmers, some of whom in India have increased their incomes by 200% since enrolling on the programme. Many are calling for a lower yield at a time when the fashion industry faces a sustainability crisis. As one of the most prominent fast-fashion retailers on the high street, Primark is widely seen as a major culprit in unnecessarily encouraging consumers to buy new products. Stewart said Primark was “one of the few options where [many of its customers] can afford to go and buy clothes” and “a lot of what we sell is what we call fashion basics - T-shirts, jeans, sweater, underwear, socks”, which people get a lot of wear from. She added that the company was “looking at what we can do to influence customers to wear clothes for longer and also what they can do with them when they no longer want them”. Primark is currently trialling recycling units at its Birmingham flagship where customers can return clothes by the brand as well as other companies. A spokesperson for Fashion Revolution, which campaigns for holistic change in the fashion industry, said: “We are happy to see Primark stepping up their efforts to source 100% sustainable cotton and, if successful, this should support hundreds of thousands more farmers, especially women, significantly improve their lives and that of their families. “We would love to see more transparency throughout the whole process, not only on their commitments but on the process and progress along the way. Ideally, they would share the learning, both good and not so good, so that others can learn from it too. We would be hoping to see both qualitative and quantitative reporting and data on the progress and impact of their work.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 22.36 BST Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 28 August. An expert panel has warned ministers that the controversial scientist Peter Ridd is misrepresenting robust science about the plight of the Great Barrier Reef, and compared his claims to the strategy used by the tobacco industry to raise doubt about the impact of smoking. The warning, in a letter to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, follows Ridd launching a lecture tour in which he has repeated his claim that farmland pollution does not significantly damage the natural wonder. Jeffrey Epstein was called a coward and a “depraved human being” in a New York courtroom on Tuesday by women who accused him of sexually abusing them as teens. At a special hearing in Manhattan, alleged victims of the disgraced financier – whose political and royal connections have come under fresh scrutiny since his arrest in New York, and who killed himself in a New York jail this month – were able to give voice to their anguish. About 20 spoke in Manhattan federal court. References to wealth inequality reaching its peak in 2017-18 were removed from an Australian Bureau of Statistics press release to help craft a “good media story”, according to internal documents. The emails and drafts show the ABS issued a separate income inequality media release in July to create a narrative of “stable” inequality despite wealth inequality being on the rise. It’s hard to put a price on what Bob Hawke meant to Australians but at an auction of the former prime minister’s possessions in Sydney on Tuesday night they did their level best. A few hundred bargain hunters and true believers gathered in an upstairs room at the Paddington RSL to bid for a piece of the people’s prime minister’s private life. As deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surges to break August records, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has escalated his row with Emmanuel Macron, attacking the French president’s “lamentable colonialist stance” as fires continued to rage in the world’s biggest rainforest. As Brazil said it would reject a US$20m (AU$29.6m) G7 contribution to fight the fires, Bolsonaro spurned Macron’s criticism of his environmental record and flaunted Donald Trump’s support for his far-right administration.

Stephens, an advocate of free speech, emailed the tweet author David Karpf’s boss to complain about a “bedbug” joke – and then quit Twitter after being widely mocked. As India loosens its stringent narcotics laws, US companies are rushing in, writes Sarah Varney. “For-profit pain clinics like Delhi Pain Management Centre are opening by the score across Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and other cities in this nation of 1.3 billion people. After decades of stringent narcotics laws, borne of debilitating opium epidemics of centuries past, India is a country ready to salve its pain. And American pharmaceutical companies – architects of the opioid crisis in the United States and avid hunters of new markets – stand at the ready to fuel that demand.” Planting an apple tree represents the investments we make in our futures and those of our children, writes Anthony N Castle. But, after a record hot Adelaide summer burned his tree’s first fruit, he wonders if the climate crisis will put an end to all that. “We had planted the tree for the children we didn’t yet have, knowing it could come to bear fruit as they grew. It was an investment in our environment for the good of our children, an investment in their future, but we found that apple among the stones of the garden bed not long after. It had fallen, burned on the branch.” Australia has been a powerhouse nation in women’s basketball for some time but, despite sharing the same talent production line, Australia’s men have failed to reach the same heights.

Depending on who you follow, Victoria Park was the holy grail or hell on earth. When Collingwood played its final home game at the beloved Lulie Street venue 20 years ago on 28 August 1999, it ended an era of tribal footy, writes Cheryl Critchley. The Farewell, Lulu Wang’s second feature film, is set in Changchun, the capital of China’s north-eastern Jilin province, whose name translates to “long spring”. For Wang, who grew up there, it was close to idyllic. In the film, however, it’s foreign and alienating, as if the city of her memories was merely imagined. “Every time I go back, it’s a completely different place, and all the things I once knew are gone,” she says. This sense of absence permeates the film, based on Wang’s own life. Billi – a Chinese-born, US-raised writer who serves as Wang’s onscreen proxy – returns to Changchun to see her nai nai (Mandarin for grandmother) one last time. Nai Nai is dying, but doesn’t know; in keeping with traditional values of collective over individual suffering, the family keeps her in the dark about her stage-four cancer diagnosis, orchestrating a last-minute wedding as a guise under which everyone reunites. “There’s this feeling of sand slipping through your fingers, of being unable to hold on to past memories and feelings. Unable to find anything concrete that represents home,” Wang says. It’s a trauma instantly recognisable to any diasporic audience – the feeling of suspension between two cultures, and the knowledge that to fully embrace one is to sacrifice the other.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.22 BST It is 9am on the shores of Lake Victoria’s Winam Gulf in Kenya’s Kisumu county. Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps. Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch. But there’s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind. “We hope that the boats arrive before the hyacinth covers this area, [because] it will be difficult for [the fishermen] to access the dry land and bring us fish,” says Elizabeth Keita, a fishmonger in the village of Dunga, as she eyes the bobbing green sheet in the distance. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the “world’s worst aquatic weed”, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers. In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds. But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria. There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters. But water hyacinth isn’t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke. “I have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,” says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers’ association. About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya’s latest demographic and health survey shows. Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about 14,300 Kenyans die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution – most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show. Outside Keita’s home on the shores of Lake Victoria, piles of cleared water hyacinth left to rot were a common site. But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine. It turns out the floating plant isn’t just good at being abundant – its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen. It’s a magic combination that has captivated researchers’ imaginations since as early as the 1980s when, across the world, they began to explore its potential as a biofuel. Just about 4kg of the dried plant was enough to cater for a large family’s daily energy needs, early research predicted. In 2014, Nigerian academics announced they had got better yields of the gas when they mixed the plant with sanitised chicken manure. A few years later, Kenyan scientists confirmed what their Nigerian peers and others had already found: animal dung worked to power charge the process of converting the weed into gas. In India, scientists took this idea and ran with it, mixing water hyacinth with the more famous Cannabis sativa, the same family of plants that marijuana comes from, as a proposed answer for periodic shortages of cow dung. In 2018, the technology came to Dunga promising a two-for-one solution to the dual menaces of the water hyacinth and dependence on firewood. The community received two donated biogas digesters – machines that would transform a mix of water hyacinth and cow dung into biogas for cooking, as well as material for other household tasks such as incubating chicks and purifying water. The “digesters” work a bit like a stomach. Food goes in one end – think of it as a mouth – and over the next 20 to 30 days, it ferments and breaks down, giving off gas that comes out the other end. From there, the clean-burning gas is piped to the point of use, just like traditional domestic gas. Currently, there are about 50 of these biogas digesters slated for Kenya. In Dunga, some are connected to multiple family stoves so that altogether they produce enough gas to serve about 60% of the village’s population. Kenya’s Biogas International company installed the stoves in partnership with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability. The project will test whether biogas can provide an effective alternative to firewood and charcoal in rural Kenyan communities. The programme is only months old but, anecdotally, it seems to be working. Keita says the members of her fishmongers’ association are already getting sick less often. And because they don’t have to devote hours a day to walking long distances to collect firewood, they’re making more money as well. Kanyiva Muindi is an epidemiologist and air pollution research fellow at the African Population and Health Research Centre in Nairobi. She says families who switch to the smokeless cooking method could expect fewer respiratory issues and even some forms of cancer because where there’s smoke, there’s PAHs – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a carcinogen released during burning of certain materials such as wood, corn cobs or cow dung, researchers recently reported. Women, young girls and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend so much time in the kitchen or outside over cooking fires. Worldwide, scientists are still exploring whether PAHs are linked to pockets of high rates of oesophageal cancer in the country. How much better the biogas stoves will be for the community’s health still needs more research, says Dominic Kahumbu Wanjihia, Biogas International’s chief executive. But unless the price of the digesters drops, it’s pretty clear that most communities will never be able to afford the machines, which sell for about $750. Kanyiva says affordability is a challenge worth addressing, given the huge health and environmental dangers posed by “dirty” fuels such as wood, charcoal and kerosene. If biogas could become affordable on a large scale, she says it “would be life-changing for millions on the African continent and beyond”. For Keita, meanwhile, one unexpected benefit of the stoves has been the way they have changed her view of water hyacinth. For years, she had regarded it as little more than a menace. But now, she says, “the hyacinth is becoming a useful resource!” This story was produced by the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 09.30 BST The UN migration agency is the subject of a formal complaint after “severe concerns” were raised about its treatment of Bangladeshi migrants, including children. A Tunis-based NGO, Forum Tunisien pour les Droits Economiques et Sociaux (FTDES), filed a complaint to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) this month, after migrants alleged officials and diplomats had put pressure on them to return home following weeks at sea. The group of 64 Bangladeshis said they felt pressed by the IOM to sign a voluntary return paper, or risk arrest. They also said diplomats from the Bangladeshi embassy had warned them that if they did not sign the voluntary return document, they would become victims of organ trafficking. “Based on the testimonies we collected, FTDES files this complaint to the IOM to raise severe concerns about the treatment of migrants by IOM Tunisia,” read the complaint. “The testimonies of the migrants were consistent and all allude to forms of malpractice on the part of IOM.” The migrants were rescued by the vessel Maridive 601 in May, only to spend another three weeks stranded at sea as European authorities refused to let them land. “According to the migrants, IOM staff members used intense psychological pressure during the interviews to force them to accept their ‘voluntary’ return to Bangladesh,” said FTDES. “They also said that when they refused to sign the AVRR form, the psychological pressure increased. The migrants attest that neither UNHCR or Unicef were present during these initial interviews, and they did not know that they had the right to claim asylum. Moreover, no medical assistance that they had asked for was provided.” The IOM has denied any pressure was applied to the migrants to return to Bangladesh, and said that all documentation was explained to them in a language they understood. IOM said migrants were informed of all options available to them regarding asylum and remaining in Tunisia. The men were among a group of 75 – about half of whom were unaccompanied children – rescued by the Maridive 601. After 19 days at sea , they were allowed to disembark in Zarzis, Tunisia, and were taken to a Red Crescent reception centre in Tunis. Over the following days, dozens of people were deported to Bangladesh through the voluntary return and reintegration programme. But nine of the migrants, interviewed by the Guardian, said they felt the IOM had put all of the Bangladeshi migrants under immense psychological pressure to return to Bangladesh while they were still on the boat, and after they’d docked. “The IOM gave us a sheet,” said one. “The documents said nobody would force us to leave. They told us the police here in Tunisia will arrest us and they don’t know when we’ll be released. The government in Bangladesh is not helping and neither are the Tunisians. Please, we want to stay.” Another said: “Every day they asked us what we had decided. They knew we didn’t want to go back, but they kept asking us anyway. They told us to sign a paper in French, but I don’t speak French. They told me to sign that paper and return to Bangladesh. But I didn’t sign it.” The men said the IOM did not provide translations. One of the men, who spoke some English, said he was asked to translate, but he said: “At the time I had no idea what a ‘minor’ was, what the ‘UNHCR’ was, or what ‘asylum’ was,” he told the Guardian. “They tried to scare us. they wanted to send us back to Bangladesh,” said another migrant. “People started to cry. I would rather be killed than go back.” A spokesman from the Bangladeshi embassy in Tripoli, which is responsible for Tunisia’s affairs, said he couldn’t comment on the specific incident, but was aware of the allegations against embassy officials, and was “taking the accusations very seriously”. He said the embassy was “willing to collaborate with the foreign ministry in Dhaka in case they decide to launch an investigation”. The embassy does not have the authority to launch its own investigation. “If it did happen, then the ministry of foreign affairs in Dhaka could go on with the charge. “This is just the beginning. We’ll be with you on this,” added the spokesman. “We know who was part of the team that led that mission.” The Bangladeshi migrants told the Guardian repeatedly that their lives would be at risk if they returned to Bangladesh. Many had accumulated debts to reach Libya and if they were to return they feared they would be threatened and tortured. One boy, who had escaped from the Tunis reception centre to avoid returning home, attempted to cross the Mediterranean again, but his boat was intercepted and he is now understood to be in detention in Libya. A relative of one of the survivors said: “In Bangladesh there are people who want to kill him. He paid all the money and went to Libya to get away from the problems in Bangladesh. Then he escaped from Libya because of the problems there. He wants to go to Europe.” A spokesman for the IOM, Leonard Doyle, said those who opted to return received counselling and had the contents of documents explained to them in a language they understood. He added: “IOM informed migrants of all available options, including asylum. IOM staff members explained the procedure to obtain residence permits for migrants who were not seeking asylum in Tunisia, but who wished to remain in the country, and informed the migrants of the fact that one of the required documents to obtain a residence permit in Tunisia is a valid passport. “The migrants who expressed a wish to stay do not have passports. Passports cannot be obtained in Tunisia. Therefore, IOM staff detailed the risk of staying in an irregular situation. It is fundamental for IOM that migrants take informed and free decisions.” FTDES has confirmed that four of the Bangladeshis who refused to sign the voluntary return agreement and decided to remain in Tunisia were eventually granted asylum seeker status by the UNHCR last week."

Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 13.10 BST Nigeria’s government stands accused of letting down its 201 million residents by failing to complete a gas supply and production agreement that would have transformed their lives. Instead, the country will now have to pay $9bn (£7.4bn) in penalties or risk having its assets seized. The accusation is being levied at the federal republic by lawyers representing Process and Industrial Developments Ltd (P&ID), a gas supply and engineering company, following a UK court ruling that paves the way for the seizure of assets belonging to Africa’s richest country. The extraordinary figure represents one-fifth of the country’s declared foreign reserves of $45bn. “Completely wrong and obviously unjustifiable”, were the words used by Nigerian government officials to describe the ruling by a judge in London last week. But yesterday, lawyers for P&ID vigorously defended their client’s position. A spokesman said: “Nigeria failed to live up to its contractual commitments … The project would have generated 2,000 MW of power for the national grid and could have been transformative for millions of Nigerians. At present, the World Bank estimates that in 2017, only 59% of the country had access to a reliable supply of electricity.” The decision, at the commercial court, converted a 2017 arbitration tribunal award into a high court judgment, and gives British Virgin Islands-registered P&ID the right to seize $9bn in assets, following the failed gas supply and processing agreement. The Nigerian government continues to dispute the UK’s jurisdiction to hear the matter, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the country’s Central Bank (CBN), said in an interview with Africa’s Premium Times: “We know that the implication of that judgment has some impact on monetary policy and that is why the CBN is going to step forward and strongly defend the country and the reserves of the federal republic of Nigeria.” But unless the Nigerian government can reach a last-minute agreement, its assets are at risk. P&ID’s barrister Andrew Stafford QC said: “P&ID is committed to vigorously enforcing its rights, and we intend to begin the process of seizing Nigerian assets in order to satisfy this award as soon as possible.” The dispute arose in 2010. Brendan Cahill, founder of P&ID, and his late business partner, Michael Quinn, signed a contract with Nigerian ministry officials in which it was agreed that the government would install pipelines and supply the gas that would connect to P&ID’s “state-of-the-art gas processing plant” in Calabar, south-east Nigeria, to be built free of charge to the state. The intention was to convert wet natural gas to dry gas to power the country’s national electric grid, improving supply. P&ID would sell 15% of the propane, ethane and butane by-products on the international market, with an expectation of generating “$5bn to $6bn in profit over a 20-year period”. In return, Nigeria would receive 85% of the gas at no cost for generating electricity. In 2012, however, the deal fell through after the Nigerian government allegedly failed to install pipelines or supply the gas. At the heart of the matter, said the government, was the fact that the company did not build the promised processing plants. P&ID claimed it was the government’s conduct that prevented them from fulfilling their side of the agreement. In a statement to the tribunal, Cahill explained that he had conceived the idea of processing gas from the Calabar region in 2006, after which P&ID “set about the necessary preparatory engineering work”. He alleges that over two years the company invested more than $40m on feasibility studies, licences, drawings and project management costs, before approaching the Nigerians. Following several years of negotiations, the parties signed the contract in 2010, during the presidency of Umaru Yar’adua. Cahill alleges that the government failed to provide the necessary technical specifications for him to meet his contract and the parties fell into dispute after he discovered the government was engaging with a third party to process the gas. During the 2015 tribunal, the Nigerian government argued that P&ID’s failure to build the gas processing plant was a fundamental breach of contract, as no gas could be delivered until this was done. The tribunal dismissed their arguments, finding them in breach of contract. In January 2017, P&ID were awarded $6.6bn and claimed interest at the rate of $1.2m a day, which increased their claim to more than $9bn. At the commercial court last week, P&ID sought to convert the tribunal’s award to a high court judgment. The Nigerian government contested the hearing, arguing that as the original contract had been signed in Nigeria, an English court had no jurisdiction, describing the tribunal’s award as “manifestly excessive”. Justice Christopher Butcher found in favour of P&ID, enforcing the $9bn award. The Nigerian government is considering its next move. Emefiele said: “There are sufficient and strong grounds on the basis of which we could file a stay of execution and also an appeal against that judgment. There are certain anomalies in the process leading to the award of that contract which are currently being looked into by the economic and financial crimes commission.” Responding to comments by Emefiele, lawyers for P&ID told the Guardian the high court judgment was “clear, decisive and consistent with prior legal findings”. “It determined that compensation must be paid as it failed to uphold its contractual commitments. The tribunal, which included a former attorney-general of Nigeria, unanimously determined that the FRN was at fault for the project’s failure. Their arguments have been comprehensively rejected.” The matter is still to be settled in the US, where P&ID are seeking permission to enforce the arbitration award. Nigeria’s defence in the US is the same as those just rejected by the English court."

Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 02.06 BST Punjab has become the latest region in Pakistan to ban plastic bags, as the country battles to reduce single-use plastics that are damaging the environment. So far there is no date for implementation in Pakistan’s most populous state. The south-eastern province of Sindh has announced it will ban polythene bags from October, and last week a ban took effect in Islamabad. Residents in the capital city will be fined $70 (£57) if they are caught using a polyethylene bag – nearly a month’s wages for a labourer. Plastic manufacturers and shopkeepers will also face fines. One shopkeeper in Islamabad was fined 200,000 PKR (£1,030) for using plastic bags, following an inspection by Farzana Altaf, director general of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency. Altaf and her staff were bustled out of the Savour Foods takeaway restaurant in the capital in an incident tweeted by Zartaj Gul, the minister of state for climate change. The manager of another store was fined 50,000 PKR. After Punjab’s chief minister affirmed the ban would happen, Gul tweeted that she was “delighted to announce that CM Punjab, @UsmanAKBuzdar has thankfully given assent to my request to ban plastic shopping bags in Punjab too!” For more than a decade, Pakistan’s provinces have imposed bans on single-use plastic bags but local governments have failed to implement the policy, and people have no cheap alternatives. But Malik Amin Aslam, adviser to the prime minister on climate change, told the Guardian: “There is a political commitment to rid Pakistan of plastic. Its use has a huge health and economic cost. And we have taken this step to make a difference and we have put heavy penalties [on those] who don’t respect the ban.” Aslam said the government would support traders seeking alternatives. “At the moment, we are introducing paper bags,” he said, adding that the cabinet had declared banning plastics “a national goal”. Hassaan Sipra, a scientific officer at the Centre for Climate Research and Development at Comsats University in Islamabad, was sceptical that change would happen. “Implementation of laws has always been an issue in Pakistan. The current government has shown a serious attitude to make this ban successful but they have to implement it and monitor too,” he said. “The government has to make a difference this time because failure has a devastating cost to the environment,” said Afia Salam, an environmental journalist. “Of course, you will not see change overnight and the effectiveness will depend on the implementing agencies.” In Islamabad, it’s still early days. At the F-6 supermarket, Kamran Ahmed wasn’t offered a paper bag when he bought vegetables. Carrying them in his hands to his car, he said: “The government has banned plastic bags but many shops are not offering alternatives in place of plastic bags. This is so frustrating.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/g7-summit-biarritz-trump-theater-looms-next-year,"Leaders put on show of common endeavour, aware that meeting could be worse next year when Trump plays circus master Julian Borger in Biarritz Mon 26 Aug 2019 20.43 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.49 BST If next year’s G7 summit turns out to be a branding event at a Trump golf resort in Florida, with Vladimir Putin as the de facto co-chair, the old guard among America’s allies will look back on this year’s meeting in Biarritz with some nostalgia. Not much was achieved, truth be told, but that is nothing new. To avoid the embarrassment of the previous year in Quebec – when Trump disowned the carefully crafted joint communiqué soon after boarding Air Force One – Emmanuel Macron, the host in Biarritz, had the wheeze of doing away with the traditional statement altogether. If there was no document, there was nothing to refuse to sign. The downside was that the meeting left little trace it had ever happened, apart from the enduring resentment of Biarritz, which was cordoned off for three days, and its residents forced to wear violet identity badges to get past the police cordons. But at least the leaders of the world’s larger industrialised democracies – loosely described as the west – put on a show of common endeavour. They put out a “declaration” with a handful of aspiration thoughts about trade, Iran, Ukraine, Libya and Hong Kong, which was thinner than the single page it was printed on. There were well-meaning statements on the need to prevent Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and some trade tensions were eased. A vow was also made to do something about the burning Amazon, with a combined down-payment of €20m, significantly less than the cost of the summit, and a particularly paltry sum in view of what was generally agreed to be an existential threat to the planet. Looming over the whole affair, however, was an awareness that everything could become a lot worse next year when Trump will be the circus-master, making a fat profit on food and lodging at his golf resort outside Miami airport. He will then be in the middle of his campaign for re-election – and therefore even less engaged or willing to compromise than he was in Biarritz. The conceit of the G7 is that it represents a club or family of like-minded nations. Next year, they could find themselves to be more little more than Trump’s paying customers. Fittingly, there was an end-of-epoch feel to the venue. Biarritz is old-world glamour, overlooking the Bay of Biscay, with gentle breezes and golden evening light on its neatly raked beaches. It evokes a grandeur from another age, when Europe was the centre of the world, and it could assume that its values would be at least admired if not emulated. One by one, surrounded by their entourages, the leaders took the morning air, strolling from their quarters at the imposing Hotel du Palais, past the art deco casino where the one-armed bandits and blackjack tables were silent for the long weekend, and up a steeply rising path to the meeting rooms at the Bellevue. There sense of importance combined with their evident impotence was reminiscent of Europe’s ruling dynasties on the eve of the first world war, oblivious to the fact their world was going to end. Boris Johnson, with his calculated dishevelled and absent-minded demeanour, came across in particular as a character actor in an Edwardian period drama, literally making his small splash by swimming out from the deserted beach to a rock with a broad opening in it, returning to declare it a metaphor for Brexit. None of the cast had a sense of theatre to match the master of ceremonies, President Macron. From the start he tried to shake the dullness and sense of futility out of the proceedings with the occasional stunt. He corralled Trump immediately on the US president’s arrival, ushering him out on to the hotel terrace where an outside table had been prepared with white linen and places set for two. It was a gambit to get to the man by himself, away from his aides. The American later declared it to have been their best meeting, but there was enough of a meeting of minds to clear the way for Macron’s second theatrical coup, flying in Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, for talks across the road from the summit, thereby creating a buzz of anticipation of a diplomatic breakthrough between Tehran and Washington at a time when they seem to be drifting towards war. At the final closing conference with Trump, Macron also had a surprise, declaring himself confident that Trump could meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani in the coming weeks. Trump, always keen for a photo op, did not rule it out. But there was no sign, as the delegations went their own way on Monday morning, that the US was prepared to take the requisite first step towards dialogue and relaxing its punishing oil embargo. Without that, the Macron initiative is doomed to remain a piece of performance hard. Again and again, Macron’s efforts at projecting progressive modernity were belied by the turgid underlying realities. There were sessions on gender equality, but when it came for the group photo of the expanded guest list as the sun set outside the Hotel du Palais, there were 24 men on the dais, and one woman, Angela Merkel, in the twilight of her political career. If there was a moment that sounded the death knell of the old order, it came at dinner in Biarritz’s antique lighthouse. The leaders were served Basque specialities and spoke about the pressing matters of the day. But the mood turned sour when Trump interrupted the flow of conversation to press the case for admitting Putin back in to the club, to make it the G8 once more. The Europeans, with the exception of the Italians, were outraged. Putin had been booted out in 2014 for breaking all the rules of the postwar world, ignoring borders and annexing Crimea. Since then he has shown no sign of reversing his land grab. Furthermore, Putin’s regime was becoming more and more repressive. Whatever hopes there might have been that he would take a turn towards economic and political form had long since dissipated. The G7, the Europeans insisted, was a family of liberal democracies or it was nothing. Trump did not seem to care; the phrase “liberal democracy” meant nothing to him. His nominal allies were stunned by his indifference to what they held sacred and his determination to act on Putin’s behalf. Macron passed the baton to Trump on Monday with a hug and a show of camaraderie. But there was a distinct sense of the established order being given its last rites – not to be replaced by anything fresh, but by a reversion to something even older and more visceral. In the new order, the aspirational talk of a fairer and greener future will be dispensed with to be replaced by the pursuit of profit, and the division of the world by a handful of powerful men."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/25/g7-the-west-takes-its-eyes-off-africa-at-its-peril,"The G7 thought it had solved Africa’s problems, but rising child poverty is a ticking time bomb Sun 25 Aug 2019 11.02 BST


Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 18.55 BST Time was when Africa dominated gatherings of the G7. In the period between two summits held in the UK – Birmingham in 1998 and Gleneagles in 2005 – the talk was of little else. There was public activism and it led to political action. In part, that was because the big developed countries were enjoying a spell of low-inflationary growth and could look beyond their own problems to see a bigger picture. There was the occasional financial panic, but the G7 thought the problems of economic management had largely been solved and all that was needed was a bit of tinkering by technocratic central bankers. Once it turned its attention to other parts of the world, the G7 found much that needed attention. There were initiatives to reduce the burden of debt, to increase aid, to improve governance and to free up trade. It helped that the UK at the time had a prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – who were committed to the cause and prepared to chivvy along the more reluctant members of the G7. Gleneagles was the culmination of the process. Public awareness was at its height and was marshalled effectively by the development movement. G7 countries talked the talk with a big package of aid and debt relief. Africa, it was thought, was sorted. Time to move on to other issues. As it turned out, the G7 was living in a fool’s paradise. It hadn’t found the secret to trouble-free growth, as the financial crisis that erupted two years after Gleneagles conclusively proved. And it certainly hadn’t sorted all Africa’s problems, even though economic management generally improved and some countries – Ethiopia, for example – grew strongly. The west took its eyes off Africa as it focused on its own problems. China, hungry for natural resources, moved in to commodity-rich African countries and provided infrastructure on a no-questions-asked basis. Countries that were rich in natural resources borrowed in the expectation that high oil and mineral prices would be sustained but, when they weren’t, growth slowed and debt problems resurfaced. Since the Gleneagles summit, the west, for the most part, has become more alive to the risks of global heating; fences have put been erected to keep out migrants; a meeting of the G7 never goes by without a commitment to keep fighting terrorism. Yet it doesn’t take a genius to work out that escaping poverty is the motivation for migrants to travel to the west, or that the failure of poor countries to provide their young adults with decent jobs breeds extremism. Birth rates are higher in poor countries, with the result that rising populations put pressure on the natural environment. All these problems are particularly acute in Africa. Even the biggest and longest walls in the world are not going to prevent poor people being lured to the west. No amount of security is going to keep societies safe from the young and angry. And any attempts to reduce carbon emissions in developed nations are going to be irrelevant if – as seems inevitable – Africa’s hunger for energy rises exponentially as its population grows. And Africa’s demographic trends are truly scary. Of the 2.4 billion increase in the world’s population between 2015 and 2050, it is estimated more than half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa. New research to be published later this week by the charity Save the Children UK and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank sums up well the risks of ignoring or underplaying Africa’s problems. That, the report says, is precisely what is happening, even though one of the United Nations 2015 sustainable development goals was a collective pledge to eradicate extreme poverty – defined as living on less than $1.90 a day – for all people everywhere. That promise will nowhere near be met on current trends. In particular, it will be broken for African children, with the SCUK/ODI research estimating that more than 300 million sub-Saharan African children will be living in extreme poverty by 2030. Birth rates are coming down, but slowly and at a less rapid pace than in other parts of the world. On average, the report notes, mothers in Africa give birth to four to five children, pushing the continent’s share of global births from about 29% today to a projected 36% by 2030. However, at the same time poverty has fallen more slowly in Africa than other regions, with an estimated 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 a day. Last year, African children accounted for 44% of world poverty; by 2030 it will be 55%. As Kevin Watkins, chief executive of SCUK, notes: “Put simply, the world’s population of children is increasing most rapidly in the region where poverty is coming down most slowly. These trends are unfolding in full view of the governments who have pledged to eradicate poverty – yet their response to child poverty has been a case study in inertia.” The SCUK/ODI study is pretty unsparing in its conclusions. It found little evidence of African governments developing coherent policy responses to growing child poverty. And the paper criticised the IMF, the World Bank and other donors for failing to put child poverty at the top of their agendas. It’s not hard to see what this agenda should be: pro-poor redistributive growth; higher public spending on health and education; investment in family planning. African child poverty matters. It is an affront to the children who are suffering and it is a time bomb primed to go off under the west. Time to start joining the dots."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs,"World powers are racing to exploit the vast untapped resources of the Arctic as global heating opens up a new frontier Simon Tisdall Sat 24 Aug 2019 20.00 BST Donald Trump’s cack-handed attempt to buy Greenland, and the shirty response of Denmark’s prime minister, provoked amusement last week. But it was mostly nervous laughter. The US intervention shone a cold light on a rapidly developing yet neglected crisis at the top of the world – the pillage of the Arctic. Like the late 19th-century “scramble for Africa”, when European empires expanded colonial control of the continent’s land mass from 10% to 90% in 40 years, the Arctic region is up for grabs. As was the case then, the race for advantage is nationalistic, dangerously unregulated, and harmful to indigenous peoples and the environment. Until relatively recently, the eight so-called Arctic nations – Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the US – maintained a broad consensus in favour of peaceful cooperation. Disputes like that between Canada and the US over the Northwest Passage and Russia’s claim to the underwater Lomonosov Ridge extending to the north pole, were regarded, literally, as frozen conflicts. But then came the climate crisis and global heating – and the dawning realisation that the Arctic’s vast, mostly untapped resources were becoming more accessible. It is believed the Arctic contains around 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil reserves and 30% of its natural gas reserves, plus huge deposits of minerals such as zinc, iron and rare earth metals. The melting ice means long-distance sea passages, such as the Northern Sea Route (NSR) from eastern Siberia to the North Atlantic, are increasingly navigable. Sailing a container ship from China to northern Europe via the NSR can shorten the journey time via the Indian Ocean and Suez canal by 10 days. With the region warming at more than twice the global average, there is a growing military and strategic dimension. Russia, the largest Arctic nation by geography, is building new military installations and power plants. A Pentagon report in June stressed the need to maintain US “competitive military advantages”. China is in on the Arctic act, too. In other words, rather than jointly tackle an emergency with existential global implications, major players appear hellbent on turning it to national advantage – and compounding it in the process. Trump’s Greenland gambit, with half an eye on mining and military bases, symbolised this blinkered mentality. To make matters worse, intensifying competition is taking place largely without rules. Under international law, the north pole and the Arctic ocean surrounding it are not owned by any country. But coastal states all have 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zones. They also maintain overlapping claims to extended continental shelf resources. Several states regard areas of the Arctic seas as territorial waters and dispute international rights of passage. Russia has unilaterally introduced regulations for NSR shipping that others reject. The US refuses to ratify the UN’s Convention on the Law of the Sea. Meanwhile, China has declared itself a “near Arctic state” – a meaningless term that implies that it, too, has rights. The chaotic consequences of this unruly race were glimpsed at this year’s annual Arctic council summit in Rovaniemi, Finland. The non-binding policies of the council, which comprises the Arctic nations and indigenous peoples’ representatives, are traditionally agreed by consensus. But this year it was hijacked by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state. Ignoring the meeting’s aim of balancing climate challenges and development, Pompeo attacked Russia and China for “aggressive behaviour”, said collaboration did not work, and vetoed a summit communique because it mentioned climate change. Russia announced an ambitious new programme to build Arctic ports, and expand an icebreaker fleet Polarising US behaviour is partly influenced by concern that it is “late to the game” in the race for the Arctic, and that Chinese-Russian cooperation there reflects a bigger, overall strategic threat. The Pentagon report said Russia regarded itself as a “polar great power” and pointed to “new military bases along its coastline [and] a concerted effort to establish air defence and coastal missile systems”. In April, Russia announced an ambitious new programme to build Arctic ports and other infrastructure, and expand an icebreaker fleet. Moscow also plans to dramatically increase NSR cargo shipments. Meanwhile, China’s development with Russia of natural gas fields such as the Yamal peninsula and its civilian research efforts were harbingers of a “strengthened future Chinese military presence” in the Arctic potentially including nuclear submarines, the Pentagon warned: “China’s predatory economic behaviour globally may be repeated in the Arctic.” The US navy is reportedly planning Arctic “freedom of navigation” operations similar to those in the South China Sea, using assets from the US 2nd Fleet that was relaunched last year to raise America’s profile in the North Atlantic and Arctic. Nato, to which five Arctic nations belong, is also taking an increased interest in the “security implications” of China’s activities, its secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said this month. All this increases the risk of conflict. China’s main focus at present is not military but on energy and resources, via investment in Arctic countries. In addition to Russian natural gas, it is prospecting for minerals in Greenland and has agreed a free-trade deal with Iceland to increase fish imports. It refers to the NSR as the “polar silk road” and there is talk of linking it to Beijing’s pan-Asian belt and road initiative. Yet like any other country, where China’s business interests lead, enhanced military, security and geopolitical engagement will surely follow. Strategic competition by the Great Powers, greed for resources, a lack of legal constraints – and the aggravating impact all this new activity will have on the climate crisis – suggest the 21st century “scramble for the Arctic” can only end badly."
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/its-2019-we-need-to-talk-about-why-most-bras-are-still-so-terrible,"Women are walking around in bad bras because the focus is on sexiness not function – who cares if women are uncomfortable? Sat 24 Aug 2019 13.00 BST


Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 13.01 BST Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Picture the scene: an attractive young woman comes home from work, grabs a beer from the fridge, and takes off her bra. The scene in question is from a new beer ad. What do you think happens next? Well, if this ad were from several years ago, the woman would hand the beer to her boyfriend and dance around him naked while he grunts and takes manly swigs. We live, however, in a glorious age where brands are passionate about Female Empowerment™. So, what actually happens next is that the woman sits on the couch, bra-less breasts still covered by her shirt, and takes happy sips of beer by herself. On-screen text declares Coors Light “the official beer of being done wearing a bra”. As far as I’m concerned Coors Light is the official beer of people who enjoy drinking dishwater – nevertheless I’ve got to admit that I find their bra-themed ad refreshing. The beer industry may slowly be waking up to the fact that more women are drinking pints and sexism doesn’t sell, but it’s still pretty rare (if not entirely unprecedented) to see an ad in which a fully-clothed female enjoys a beer at home by herself. There’s a problematic aspect to this, of course – alcohol-related deaths amongst women are on the rise – but it’s still encouraging to see advertising conventions get broken down. The Coors spot may be Feminism Light but it’s a step forward from the sort of frat-boy humour that used to characterize beer marketing. Perhaps what’s most refreshing about the Coors campaign, however, is its frank acknowledgment that bras are awful. Seriously, we need to talk about the fact that bras are terrible a lot more than we do. It’s 2019, for God’s sake! We’ve developed mind-reading robots, jet-powered hoverboards, and self-driving cars. But it still remains ridiculously difficult to find a comfortable bra, particularly if you’re bigger than a B-cup. And this isn’t just painful – it has more wide-ranging ramifications. A 2015 study found that that not being able to find a good sports bra stopped a significant number of women from exercising. One of the reasons so many women are walking around in bad bras is because, just like beer, lingerie ads have traditionally been targeted towards men. The focus has been on sexiness not function. Who cares if women are uncomfortable, after all? Thankfully, things are slowly changing. Victoria’s Secret is struggling while new women-led underwear brands are popping up and putting comfort first. There’s still a way to go before bras are a joy to wear but at least progress is being made. I’ll drink (something other than a Coors Light) to that! The labour movement is so hot right now – particularly in Philadelphia, where single guys are reportedly boasting about their union memberships on their Tinder profiles. I’m sure we can all agree this is a far better trend than posing with a large dead fish. It’s also a step up from “dogfishing.” Thursday marked “Equal Pay Day” for black women in America: meaning it took almost 20 months for a black woman to make what her white male counterpart did in 2018. Black women are paid 61 cents for every dollar their white male peers earn; white women earn about 80 cents for each dollar. Unequal pay isn’t getting any better: this year’s Black Women’s Pay Day came two weeks later than it did last year. A new poll has found that anti-abortion voters are far more hostile to gender equality than pro-choice voters. The sexist stereotype has been thoroughly debunked by researchers at UCLA, who found cat-owners weren’t any more likely to be more depressed, anxious or isolated than other pet owners. It’s not clear whether the study was funded by the Feline Industry. A 53-year-old Colombian man has been arrested in Madrid after taking over 550 upskirting videos. He posted almost 300 of these to pornographic websites. If you haven’t read about Pia Klemp yet, please drop everything and do so. Kelp is a German ship captain who refused to accept a medal for her work rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean. In a Facebook post published on Tuesday, Klemp announced she would reject a French award for bravery because honours like that are hypocritical. “[Y]ou raid protests and criminalize people that are standing up for rights of migrants and asylum seekers ... You want to give me a medal for actions that you fight in your own ramparts,” Klemp wrote. “We do not need authorities deciding about who is a ‘hero’ and who is ‘illegal,’ “ she continued. “In fact they are in no position to make this call, because we are all equal.” This is what a feminist looks like. The “Chosen One” has lost a lot of support amongst female voters, however there are still a few women who choose to believe Trump is a strident feminist. “There’s not a person alive that literally has done so much for … the female population,” Tana Goertz, a Trump Team Coordinator in Iowa gushed to reporters on Wednesday. “I can’t think of one person … except for Mother Teresa. I mean, literally, who has done more for women in office than Donald Trump?” Literally, it’s a very tough question. I’m going to have to get back to you on that."

We would ask the media to respect the family’s privacy at this extremely difficult time.” Police said a Piper plane set off on Sunday morning from an airfield in western Switzerland and was heading for Italy, but less than 90 minutes later it crashed above the Simplon pass area near the Italian border and burst into flames, according to an Associated Press report. The bodies of the pilot, a passenger and a small child were recovered from the wreckage, the news agency said. Jonathan Goldstein was the founder and creative director of Goldstein Music Group, a music production agency in London whose clients include HBO and the Royal Shakespeare Company. He had prolific composing credits in film, theatre, TV and advertising. Hannah Goldstein was a saxophonist who performed at venues including the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Festival Hall, and was a regular at the BBC Proms. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “Our staff are assisting the relatives of a British family who died in a plane accident in western Switzerland and are also in contact with the local authorities.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.30 BST Name: HELCH. Age: About one year old. Appearance: Um … HELCH. And who or what is a helch? It’s a word. I understand that. But what does it mean? It means someone has written the word HELCH on something. Are you trying to annoy me? No, but someone is. Whoever is responsible for HELCH has made a lot of enemies, by painting it in block capitals on various buildings and bridges in the south of England. Ah! So it’s a graffiti tag? That’s right. It seems that the first one arrived, very controversially, last September, on the side of the Chalfont viaduct over the M25, north-west of London. Isn’t graffiti always controversial, being vandalism and thus not allowed? Yes, but this one replaced a very popular piece of graffiti, which had been there for many years, which read GIVE PEAS A CHANCE. How sweet. But over the course of three nights, it was turned into GIVE HELCH A BREAK. So they vandalised the vandalism? I’m afraid so. To date, 6,919 people have signed a petition to restore the original, without success. Network Rail, which owns the viaduct, can’t encourage illegal graffiti, you see. I suppose not. Still, I hope whoever was behind it learned a lesson from the backlash. I don’t think they did. Over the past year, HELCH has started to appear all over London, sometimes replacing historic and much loved “ghost signs”, such as the Philco advert in Hanger Lane, or another in Chalk Farm. That’s just mean. Then, this month, HELCH went to Bristol, where the words “Boris is …” had recently been removed from a bridge over the M4. The same site now reads, “Boris is HELCH”. I suppose at least Boris Johnson will prefer that. Most shockingly of all, a gigantic (3m by 18m) HELCH recently appeared on the side of another viaduct in Windsor – right in front of Windsor Castle as you enter the town. Good heavens! I know. “The Queen was extremely upset,” according to an unnamed royal source at the Sun. What about all the other residents of Windsor? Many locals want the Windsor HELCH removed. Except … again, it is painted on Network Rail’s property, and its policy is to remove only graffiti that has an obscene meaning. Which “Helch” doesn’t? Not as far as we know. It’s a conundrum. Maybe the Queen could tell her servants to add some swearwords overnight? Then Network Rail would have to clean it off. Good plan! Assuming Her Majesty knows any swearwords? I expect Philip can help with that … Do say: “Why do people have to deface public buildings just to get our attention?” Don’t say: “Because it works?”"

First published on Mon 26 Aug 2019 14.19 BST The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has condemned what he called “extraordinarily rude” comments made about his wife, Brigitte, by the far-right Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro, escalating their diplomatic clash. “He has made some extraordinarily rude comments about my wife,” Macron said at a press conference at the G7 summit in Biarritz when asked to react to statements about him by the Brazilian government. “What can I say? It’s sad. It’s sad for him firstly, and for Brazilians,” he added. Over the weekend Bolsonaro personally expressed approval online for a Facebook post implying that Brigitte Macron was not as good-looking as his own wife, Michelle Bolsonaro. A Bolsonaro supporter posted: “Now you understand why Macron is persecuting Bolsonaro?” next to an unflattering picture of Brigitte Macron, 65, who is 28 years older than Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle. Bolsonaro himself replied on Facebook: “Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha.” Macron said: “I think Brazilian women will probably be ashamed to read that from their president. I think that Brazilians, who are a great people, will probably be ashamed to see this behaviour … And as I feel friendship and respect towards the Brazilian people, I hope that they will very soon have a president who behaves in the right way.” Since forest fires swept through the Amazon this month, Macron and Bolsonaro have been locked in a war of words seen as the worst diplomatic crisis between France and Brazil in 40 years. Macron tweeted of the Amazon blazes: “Our house is literally on fire”, calling it a global crisis and criticising Brazil’s management of the Amazon. France accused Bolsonaro of lying to Macron over his commitment to combating the climate emergency, saying Paris would no longer support the Mercosur deal with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Mercosur, officially known as the southern common market, is a South American trading bloc. It was formed in 1991 by the treaty of Asunción signed between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The aim of Mercosur is to make trade and economic development easier between the nations by removing tariffs and forming a customs union, similar to the European Union’s single market. Mercosur also negotiates free trade agreements on behalf of member states. With a combined GDP of nearly $3.5tn, Mercosur can claim to be the fifth largest economy in the world, representing a population of more than 295 million. Bolivia is in the final stages of joining the group, and Venezuela is a full member but is currently suspended. Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname are associate members, giving them preferential access to the market without being part of the customs union or having any voting rights. The supra-national Mercosur parliament first sat in 2007 but it only has advisory powers over the common market council, which is Mercosur’s highest decision-making body. Macron pointed out that the French overseas territory of French Guiana on the northern coast of South America is France’s biggest land border, so the Amazon was particularly important for France because “we are there”. Bolsonaro then publicly attacked Macron for what he called a “colonialist mentality”."

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.29 BST Parts of eastern Spain and the Balearic islands are bracing for heavy rains after Madrid and the surrounding area were battered by violent storms, torrential hail, and flash flooding. Roads around the Spanish capital were flooded, flights diverted from Barajas airport and underground services affected on Monday night as an isolated depression at high levels moved across the centre of the Iberian peninsula. The skies over Madrid were lit up by more than 9,300 bolts of lightning, according to Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet. One of the worst-hit areas was the satellite town of Arganda del Rey, where cars and rubbish bins were carried away by the torrents and residents used shovels to clear roads and pavements of drifts of hail. Aemet said the town had experienced 46.4 litres of rainfall per square metre as the storms rolled in. Arganda’s underground station remained closed on Tuesday morning and the council set up a centre to help those affected by the floods. On Monday night, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the president of the Madrid region, said firefighters had dealt with more than 200 incidents and asked people to take care. Madrid’s emergency services said they had been called to 1,134 incidents between 4pm and 9pm on Monday and had worked to clear trees and branches from roads and deal with flood waters and inundated garages and basements. Aemet said the cold front was moving eastwards, and placed Valencia, Alicante, Murcia and the Balearics on orange alert. “Things remain unclear, but we expect the isolated depression at high levels to continue its progress east, bringing rain and uncertainty to a large part of the peninsula and the Balearics,” it said. “Strong or very strong and persistent squalls and storms are likely in the Valencia region, Murcia and the western part of the Balearics.” Aemet said the stormy weather would continue until Wednesday morning, when the depression would move towards northern Italy. An Aemet spokesman said that while such a weather phenomenon was more commonly seen in the autumn months, it did sometimes bring hail and heavy rain in August. “What happened yesterday is that the Madrid area, which bore the brunt of it, isn’t a region that’s very accustomed to these levels of precipitation,” Rubén del Campo said. “It’s normally the Mediterranean regions that get the most torrential rain. But it does sometimes happen and we saw very intense rain and hail in Arganda del Rey.” Del Campo said it was clear that higher sea and air temperatures provided more energy and more fuel for more intense storms when the atmospheric conditions are right. He added: “It’s very difficult to say that what happened in Madrid yesterday was down to climate change, but we are living in a situation where there’s no doubt that these higher temperatures mean there’s more water vapour in the atmosphere – and that’s the fuel that feeds the storms. That’s a fact.”"

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.55 BST Iran has sentenced a British-Iranian man to 12 years in prison after accusing him of spying for Israel, while upholding the 10-year sentence of another UK resident. A spokesman for the Iranian judiciary, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said on Tuesday that Anousheh Ashouri – the latest Iranian national with a western passport to be detained in Iran – had been sentenced to 12 years for ties to Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Ashouri’s sentence included 10 years for allegedly feeding information to Israeli intelligence and two years for receiving €33,000 (£30,000) in illicit funds from the country. She was ordered to pay the same amount in fines. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK was supporting Ashouri’s family and the embassy in Tehran was continuing to request consular access. The spokesperson said the FCO urged Iran to allow all dual nationals detained in Iran to be reunited with their families. Meanwhile an appeals court upheld a 10-year prison sentence against Aras Amiri, an Iranian national and British Council worker. Amiri was living in London when she was arrested in 2018 during a trip to Iran to visit relatives. Last week Amiri’s fiance, James Tyson, accused the UK government of being “utterly blind to their responsibility” to try to secure her release. He said British officials had initially claimed they could not help Amiri because she was an Iranian citizen. Amiri, who worked as an artistic affairs officer for the British Council, was arrested last year when she was visiting her ailing grandmother in Iran. In May she was sentenced to prison on spying charges after she claimed she had refused to become an informant for Iran’s intelligence service. Esmaili said she had been identified “because of her cultural infiltration in society through arts and her widespread activities”. Tyson said his fiance had become close to her cellmate, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British citizen serving a five-year sentence for alleged spying. “They’re sort of housemates in many ways. They’re very supportive of each other … telling stories, sharing books they have and cooking together,” he said. “In many ways it’s good that they could have each other, actually, through this time.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested by Iranian authorities in 2016 as she was leaving Tehran. An Iranian national, Ali Johari, was also sentenced to 12 years in jail on Tuesday after being accused of spying for Israel. Esmaili said Johari had “widespread connections with Mossad” and had met “various elements linked to the Zionists”. The verdicts came amid tensions between Iran and Britain, a US ally, over the seizure of oil tankers in recent weeks. An Iranian tanker was seized off the British overseas territory of Gibraltar on 4 July on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. That vessel has been released but Iran continues to hold a British-flagged tanker it seized in the Gulf on 19 July for breaking “international maritime rules”. A statement from the FCO said: “The treatment of all dual nationals detained in Iran is a priority and we raise their cases at the most senior levels. We urge Iran to let them be reunited with their families.”"

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 06.25 BST A senior Brazilian official has told Emmanuel Macron to take care of “his home and his colonies” as Brazil rejected an offer from G7 countries of $20m (£16m) to help fight fires in the Amazon. “We appreciate [the offer], but maybe those resources are more relevant to reforest Europe,” Onyx Lorenzoni, the chief of staff to President Jair Bolsonaro, told the G1 news website. Leaders of the G7 countries made the aid offer at a weekend summit in the French city of Biarritz hosted by the French president, who had put the fires high on the agenda. Environmental campaigners have dismissed the sum as “chump change”. “Macron cannot even avoid a foreseeable fire in a church that is a world heritage site,” Lorenzoni said in a reference to the blaze that devastated the Notre Dame cathedral in April. “What does he intend to teach our country? “Brazil is a democratic, free nation that never had colonialist and imperialist practices, as perhaps is the objective of the Frenchman Macron.” The Brazilian presidency later confirmed the comments to Agence France-Presse. Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, had earlier told reporters that his country welcomed the G7 funding, but after a meeting between Bolsonaro and his ministers, the Brazilian government changed course. The announcement of the $20m assistance package was the most concrete outcome of the three-day G7 summit of major industrialised democracies in Biarritz and aimed to give money to Amazonian nations such as Brazil and Bolivia, primarily to pay for more firefighting planes. Tensions have risen between France and Brazil after Macron tweeted that the fires burning in the Amazon basin amounted to an international crisis and should be discussed as a top priority at the G7 summit. Bolsonaro reacted by accusing Macron of having a “colonialist mentality”. Speaking on French TV on Monday night, Macron reiterated that the Amazon was a global issue and intensified his criticism of Bolsonaro. “We respect your sovereignty. It’s your country,” Macron said. But the trees in the Amazon are “the lungs of the planet”, he added. “The Amazon forest is a subject for the whole planet. We can help you reforest. We can find the means for your economic development that respects the natural balance. But we cannot allow you to destroy everything.” He also acknowledged that Europe, by importing soya from Brazil, was not without blame for the agricultural pressure on the rainforest, saying: “We are partly complicit.” The diplomatic row between the leaders had escalated earlier in the day, when Macron condemned Bolsonaro for what he called “extraordinarily rude” comments made about his wife, Brigitte, after the Brazilian president expressed approval online for a Facebook post implying that Brigitte Macron was not as good-looking as his own wife, Michelle. “He has made some extraordinarily rude comments about my wife,” Macron said at a press conference in Biarritz when asked to react to statements about him by the Brazilian government. “What can I say? It’s sad. It’s sad for him firstly, and for Brazilians,” he added. Macron said he hoped for the sake of the Brazilian people “that they will very soon have a president who behaves in the right way”. The US president, Donald Trump, skipped the summit session aimed at finding solutions to global heating through tree planting and shifting from fossil fuels to wind energy. In a press conference after the summit, he was dismissive of efforts to change direction. “I feel the US has tremendous wealth … I’m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills – which, frankly, aren’t working too well,” he said. “I think I know more about the environment than most.” Environmental groups said G7’s emergency fire aid was insufficient and failed to address the trade and consumption drivers of deforestation. “The offer of $20m is chump change, especially as the crisis in the Amazon is directly linked to overconsumption of meat and dairy in the UK and other G7 countries,” said Richard George, the head of forests for Greenpeace UK.

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 21.31 BST Thailand’s palace has released rare images and a biography of the king’s newly anointed royal consort, including candid and action-packed photos of her aiming a weapon on a firing range, piloting a plane and preparing to parachute. King Maha Vajiralongkorn bestowed the rank of “Chao Khun Phra”, or noble consort, on the 34-year-old former army nurse Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi on his 67th birthday in July. She is the first woman to receive the noble rank in nearly a century. The publication of the more than 60 photos and a 46-page biography was dated last week, but did not start circulating online until Monday. “The king has ordered the creation of a royal biography for Chao Khun Phra Sineenat Bilaskalayani,” a statement from the royal office said, using her full title. The images and details provide an unusually intimate glimpse into the private lives of the powerful, ultra-wealthy monarchy, which is protected by a royal insult law that carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison per count. They show Sineenat in camouflage fatigues, taking part in military drills, flying a small plane, and laughing at a table with the king, with both wearing casual clothes. In one of the photos she is shown in traditional Thai dress standing next to Vajiralongkorn and holding his hand. Born in the northern province of Nan, she graduated from the Royal Thai army nursing college, trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, and served in the king’s royal bodyguard unit, reaching the rank of major general in May. A cycling and aviation enthusiast who spends much of his time abroad in Germany, Vajiralongkorn was crowned in May in an elaborate three-day ceremony in which Sineenat participated. The ceremony took place days after a surprise announcement that Vajiralongkorn had married Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya, a former flight attendant and deputy commander of the monarch’s security detail. Suthida is the fourth wife of the monarch, who has a teenage son from his third marriage and six other children. The king is not as well-known to the public as his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In the run-up to his coronation, billboards and government offices were peppered with large imposing portraits of him."

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 18.35 BST The Berlin Philharmonic, considered by many to be the world’s finest orchestra, ushered in a new era in its 137-year history at the Philharmonie concert hall on Friday. Simon Rattle, the orchestra’s chief conductor since 2002, stepped down last year after a reportedly turbulent 16-year tenure. Rattle is now back in the UK, the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, and in his place in Berlin is the 47-year-old Russian-Austrian conductor Kirill Petrenko. In his inaugural concert as chief conductor, Petrenko led the orchestra in scenes from Alban Berg’s opera Lulu, and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. He first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2006 and apparently cemented his hold on their hearts when in 2009 he performed Elgar’s Second Symphony, but Friday night was a moment of real occasion, the equivalent in orchestral terms of the unveiling of the next James Bond or Doctor Who. Many people did indeed ask “who?” when Petrenko’s appointment was announced back in 2015 following a secret vote by the orchestra’s musicians (in Berlin, unlike other leading orchestras, the players not the management have the power to fire and hire their conductor). Petrenko had spent the previous decade working in German opera houses, becoming a highly respected musician also known for his extreme shyness and an ardent dislike of giving interviews. As he takes over in Berlin, he remains music director of the Bavarian State Opera – but his profile is slight, especially outside Germany. But in an age when conductors are meant to be social-media savvy, Petrenko presumably thinks tweeting is for the birds – and, characteristically, has not uttered a word to newspapers or magazines about his new appointment. A decade ago, the Berlin Philharmonic’s response to a collapse in revenue from commercial recording was to launch their Digital Concert Hall. A record label followed. Rattle’s presence as friendly talking-head, willing to speak about anything from Bach to Stravinsky and beyond, has been key to the success of both. Some adjustment, in the Petrenko era, will certainly be necessary – or he will need to hone his skills as a communicator. Walking on stage to conduct this concert, surely the apex of his career, Petrenko looked more like a man who had come to fix your boiler than one assuming the mantle of the most sought-after job in conducting. There was no basking in the warm applause that accompanied his entrance. The briefest of nods in acknowledgement, and it was straight to the podium. And, as the weave of intricately knitted, hushed strings of Berg’s Lulu began, it was obvious why the orchestra wanted Petrenko. He has a gift for illuminating the innards of a score. After the interval, his high-velocity Beethoven crackled with muscular rhythmic energy. On occasion he stopped beating time and leaned in towards a particular section of players, like a painter intensifying the detail of his brushstrokes – a strategy that, in Beethoven’s hell-for-leather second movement, provoked an apocalyptic eruption from the general direction of the double basses. This suggests the reports of the explosive Beethoven Seventh Symphony he brought to last year’s Proms were no fluke – Petrenko is a deep thinker about music, who reliably brings out the best in an orchestra. One criticism aimed at Rattle, who expanded the orchestra’s repertoire into the likes of modern British music and US jazz, was that the core German repertoire suffered neglect (unfair given that he recorded Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven and Mahler with the Philharmonic). The last time I was at the Philharmonie I saw the British conductor lead the audience in a Conga from Leonard Bernstein’s musical Wonderful Town. Petrenko isn’t going to be dancing in the aisles. Recording and education outreach work will continue, but in terms of repertoire the Berlin Phil has clearly decided to refocus – and Petrenko, they feel, is the man to reconnect them with their core concerns."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.05 BST This was the culmination of Edinburgh international festival’s four-year Ring cycle in concert and as such one of the hottest tickets at this year’s EIF. Such anticipation can lead to disappointment, but this proved to be an event that lived up to its hype. Andrew Davis and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the partnership behind the lauded Walküre at the 2017 festival, once again took to the Usher Hall stage for the final instalment of Wagner’s epic music drama. Apparently, the original intention was to have a different orchestra-conductor partnership for each opera but so successful was the Davis-RSNO collaboration in Walküre that they got the call up for Götterdämmerung. Many of the singers had likewise appeared in previous instalments, but none was more central to the success of the performance than soprano Christine Goerke. Having scaled the heights of the complete Ring cycle at the Metropolitan Opera earlier this year, Goerke is the Brünnhilde of the moment. It’s not difficult to see why. Her luminous soprano has the vocal strength to surmount the mighty Wagnerian orchestra without sounding forced or harsh. Allied with genuine dramatic capabilities, hers is an all-too-human account of the warrior goddess, a seductive combination of pathos and power. Goerke’s may have been the standout performance but there was plenty of interest elsewhere, particularly Ain Anger’s splendidly world-weary, implacable Hagen and Karen Cargill in the dual roles of Waltraute and Second Norn. Greek soprano Danae Kontora, who made an impression as a last-minute stand-in Woodbird in Siegfried, returned in her own right as an equally flirtatious Rhinemaiden. Burkhard Fritz, a new addition to the cast, was a solid although rather soft-toned Siegfried. Wagner in the concert hall can be as much symphony as opera but Andrew Davis’s coolly measured controlled approach ensured that the performance was never static or self-indulgent. It might have been a little restrained for those who like their Wagner swooning and swooping, but its elegant pacing brought life to the light and shade of the music; the ecstatic outpourings sudden and exciting. Under his direction a vibrant, energised RSNO gave a burnished, nuanced account of the score. At the close of the EIF, it was a timely reminder that at their best festivals can foster artistic partnerships to create something truly outstanding. Broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 21 September."

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 15.47 BST Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after 125 years of continued membership after the EFL board finally ran out of patience with its financial collapse and owner, Steve Dale. He had been given a deadline of 5pm BST on Tuesday, after a series of previous deadlines were not met, either to provide proof he has the money to finance the club and its debts or to conclude a sale. At 3pm on Tuesday a proposed deal to sell the club to C&N Sporting Risk, a data and analytics company owned by Rory Campbell, formerly a technical scout and analyst at West Ham, and Henry Newman, a coach and former joint manager of Barnet, collapsed. Campbell and Newman announced in a statement they were unable to resolve problems relating to a mortgage on the Gigg Lane ground and “the overall financial state of the club”, and were not proceeding. Their statement explicitly made clear the breakdown was not because of the tight deadline but “reflective of the systemic failings of a football club over a number of years”. The EFL board – six club representatives with the executive chair, Debbie Jevans, and the nonexecutive director Simon Bazalgette – then considered Bury’s position in a meeting conducted by conference call beginning at 5pm. Bury had been given a 14-day notice of expulsion from the EFL on 9 August, which was due to expire on Friday, until it was extended to Tuesday. Some EFL sources were making it clear that, despite the groundswell of sympathy for a historic club and their supporters, a view was hardening that the club had failed to pay their way, winning promotion despite being unable to pay their players, and that the EFL board needed to assert its seriousness by sticking to so firm a deadline. In a statement released at 11.04pm after long consideration, which included Dale saying that three last-minute offers had been made, the EFL board announced that it had decided Bury’s membership of the league would be withdrawn. “Having fully considered all available options, including a number of late expressions of interest provided to the EFL, the EFL board has unanimously determined with enormous regret that Bury’s membership be withdrawn.” The statement added that the board believed there should be an investigation into the financial ruins of the club: “Recent events have highlighted how decisions taken at Bury FC over the last few seasons have caused the club and individuals close to it significant financial distress and there are a number of matters which, in our view, will require further investigation.” Bury’s name will be removed from League One and the Football League for the first time since the club joined the old Second Division in 1894. League One will be played between 23 clubs, including Bolton. Three clubs will be relegated at the end of the season and four promoted from League Two and the clubs will discuss at their next meeting in September how to deal with the number of clubs in League Two. The expulsion of the stalwart club is a monumental failure under Dale, who bought Bury for £1 in December from Stewart Day. He had maintained them since his own takeover in 2013 with borrowings from his property companies. A mortgage on Gigg Lane was taken out during Day’s tenure with a firm based in Crosby, Capital Bridging Finance Solutions, about which Dale publicly raised concerns after taking over, saying the loans were up to £3.7m. When the loans were made, 40% of the money did not go to Bury but was instead paid to unnamed third parties as introduction fees. Angry scenes now outside Gigg Lane where growing number of fans are gathering, some chanting “We want Dale out” pic.twitter.com/Bnheey7epG Campbell and Newman are understood to have been particularly concerned about that mortgage and were unable to reach an agreement with Capital for a reduced figure to pay off the £3.7m and release it. Within weeks of Day selling the club several of his property companies collapsed into administration, owing millions to lenders and investors. Dale, however, never satisfied the league that he had the necessary money to sustain the club, a requirement of EFL rules for new owners before a takeover or, at the latest, 10 days later. Throughout nine months in charge Dale has never provided the EFL with the evidence of funding it has required. Finally, after the club’s first five matches were suspended, and repeated deadlines missed, the EFL board met with a resolution not to delay again and expelled a 134-year-old fixture of English football."

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.50 BST After such grinding and unnecessary failures precipitating expulsion from the Football League for Bury, a 134-year-old club founded by late Victorian civic-minded chaps in 1885, there have to be inquiries, lessons learned and reforms. The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent such an implosion ever happening again. The Labour MP for Bury North, James Frith, who has worked relentlessly to expose ugly truths and to help save the club, has called for investigations and parliamentary scrutiny. The two modern, analytical young football men, Rory Campbell and Henry Newman, who decided not to proceed with their deadline-day proposed purchase, made clear in their statement that stronger governance is needed and the Bury wreckage was the result of “systemic failings ... over a number of years”. That appeared to be a diplomatically worded signal that they had been quite appalled by what they had found in the ruins of a stalwart EFL club. In particular, alongside the insolvency which resulted in a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) denying suppliers, HMRC and other creditors 75% of the money Bury owed them, and the still outstanding wages due to players who won promotion last season, was a mortgage on Gigg Lane which Campbell and Newman appear to have found repellent. The mortgage was taken out in stages by the previous owner, Stewart Day, who in December, as his own property empire was about to collapse into insolvency, sold the club to Steve Dale for £1. The lender, a firm based in Crosby called Capital Bridging Finance Solutions (“Capital”), is now owed £3.7m. Capital in turn mortgaged Gigg Lane, most homely of football grounds, to a company based in Malta whose own lenders were eight companies registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. As revealed in the Guardian, large portions of the borrowed money never came to Bury at all, because 40% was paid as “introduction fees” to unnamed third parties. Day justified that by saying it enabled a low interest rate, understood latterly to be 6%, but it is safe to say that one would not expect to find an arrangement like that on Bury’s home ground. That – along with another mortgage on the social club and what they politely described as “the overall financial state of the club” – was perhaps a major reason for Campbell and Newman deciding they did not really need the steaming mess at Bury in their currently prospering lives. This collapse, alongside Bolton Wanderers broken down up the road, makes an awful spectacle for English football, a global behemoth feasting on its greatest ever boom. The Premier and Football Leagues have fended off periodic political moves towards independent regulation by arguing their rules are robust. But the Bury ruins contain toxic pointers towards clear holes in governance, and the EFL clubs – who make the rules and have been slow to strengthen them over many years – must now rapidly reform. As Frith established, and the EFL confirmed, Dale completed his £1 takeover without ever complying with the league’s rules that new owners must demonstrate they have the money to sustain a club, “proof of funding”. A major flaw in the rules is the lack of appropriate sanction for an owner who flouts them: the takeover cannot be denied. Instead a registration embargo was imposed and matches were suspended, but Bury itself – the club, loyally supported – were faced with the threat of expulsion, and not Dale himself. The “fit and proper person” owners and directors test is waiting to be expanded into more than just a basic check of criminal convictions, but having agreed that in principle last summer, the clubs have still not settled on the practicalities. Other EFL rules, much vaunted, to encourage clubs to spend within their means on players’ wages are deeply flawed because owners are allowed to pour in extra money to pay them, as long as they invest it as shares rather than loans. That is apparently what Stewart Day did, signing players Bury could not afford by lending money from his property companies and converting those millions into shares. But when his companies fell into multimillion-pound insolvencies, he had no more money for Bury and the club’s wage bill was immediately ruinous. The alarm should have been rung in 2014, when Day took out a loan with 138% annual interest secured on Gigg Lane, but it never was and he was able to continue. Although there is widespread sympathy for Bury supporters and deep sentiment for the football heritage, among other clubs and many fans there is also exasperation at the promotion from League Two won last season with an excellent team the club could not afford to pay. Hence the support from clubs for the firm line maintained by the EFL board. Frith has also called for an investigation into the deal by which a company, RCR Holdings, bought for £70,000 any potential claim against Bury by Day’s company Mederco, which is in administration. The Mederco administrator told creditors it was uncertain if a claim could be made, as loans from Mederco did appear to have been converted into shares at the club. Nevertheless, the potential claim was admitted into the Bury CVA as a £7m debt owed to Mederco. RCR’s £7m vote enabled Dale to have the CVA passed with the necessary majority of creditors. RCR’s sole owner and director, Kris Richards, confirmed to BBC Radio Manchester that he is Dale’s daughter’s partner. Dale responded: “All dealings with the CVA have been done in a correct and proper manner.” So that is where the Victorian founders’ beautiful game, with its sporting values and character‑building virtues, got to at Gigg Lane, Bury, in 2019."

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.41 BST A day that began with optimism ended in despair, disbelief and fury in Bury as one of England’s oldest football clubs was kicked out of the English Football League (EFL) after 125 years. The future of Bury FC was plunged into grave doubt after the 134-year-old club was expelled from the league at 11pm on Tuesday, hours after the collapse of an 11th-hour rescue deal Thirteen miles away, the fate of Bolton Wanderers also looked increasingly perilous as the club was given 14 days to save its membership in a league it helped found in 1888. The process of closing down the club could begin as early as Wednesday. There was widespread shock and demands for reform of football governance when Bury’s dramatic expulsion was announced by the EFL, which described it as “undoubtedly one of the darkest days in the league’s recent history”. It is understood that the EFL rejected late pleas for Bury to be given a 24-hour extension to its deadline, up to 5pm on Wednesday, to thrash out a deal between the owner Steve Dale and two new potential bidders after a sale to the data company C&N Sporting Risk fell through shortly before Tuesday’s deadline. Ivan Lewis, the independent MP for Bury South, said the expulsion was a “devastating blow to us all” and that securing the club’s future was “now a massively uphill struggle and to give people false hope would be unfair”. “On the other hand, we can’t afford to leave any stone unturned and the fight goes on,” he said. Lewis said Dale had agreed in principle to sell the club to a potential owner before 5pm but that the EFL refused to allow more time for a deal to be done: “That’s one of the issues we want to discuss with the league as a matter of great urgency … But all options remain open to us – the fans, the council, the MPs – and we’re not going to lie down and die.” The Labour MP James Frith said Bury had been “the victim of a joint enterprise crime” by “an inadequate football administrator [and] a toxic and ignorant ownership of the football club – both current and previous”.Frith, who represents Bury North, said the EFL response to the club’s crisis had been “wholly inadequate” and that reforming the governing body was “top of the to-do list”.Frith condemned the EFL for giving Bury a deadline extension of one working day to hammer out a deal and insisting that negotiations took place exclusively with C&N Sporting Risk, despite knowing that other credible bidders were interested.“There is an institutional failure in football governance in this country and that’s what we’re facing now The impact of that is the town of Bury, which has suffered from austerity, 10 years plus of neglect as a town in the shadow of Manchester, that has a great deal to offer, has now lost a force of influence, economic and cultural capital,” he added. Hundreds of volunteers gathered at Bury’s Gigg Lane stadium earlier in the day, scrubbing toilets and cleaning the stands in the hope the club would survive and play its delayed first game of the season on Saturday. Those hopes were dashed when the English Football League announced shortly before 5pm that the late takeover deal had collapsed, as crowds of anxious fans, some in tears, gathered outside the ground. Stephen Farrar, 26, one of hundreds who spent hours cleaning stands in anticipation of Bury’s first game of the season going ahead on Saturday, said: “My legs are shaking – I just feel like I’m going to cry to be honest. I know people are saying ‘still believe’ but I don’t know how it can [survive]. I’m devastated.” The fate of Bury and Bolton, two of the oldest clubs in English football, has fuelled calls for a complete overhaul of the rules and regulations governing the sport in Britain. Outside Gigg Lane, Clive Roberts, 73, said he had travelled 7,000 miles from his home in Canada hoping to watch his beloved club’s first few games of the season “only to find I was attending a wake”. Roberts said his great grandfather watched Bury win the FA Cup in 1903, while his own father played for the RAF team at Gigg Lane during the second world war. “I hoped my own grandchildren would be coming here in years to come – that’s not going to be the case,” he said. “The family will lose that link to Bury and lose what the history of the area means. It’s a very emotional day – I’m trying to hold it in. It maybe hasn’t hit home yet but it will.” Greg Edyvean, 38, has had a season ticket at Gigg Lane since he was six weeks old. He continued the tradition with his own two children, now aged 12 and two. As the news of the deal’s collapse filtered through, Edyvean was allowed to sit alone in his regular seat inside the stadium. “I’ve been sat there for the best part of two hours in tears,” he said. “It’s my favourite place on earth and it could be the last time it happens. It’s horrific. There’s not words to describe it.” Some volunteers drove 300 miles to take part in the clean-up operation, with plumbers, bricklayers, electricians all chipping in alongside fans of rival clubs including Leeds United, Accrington Stanley and Blackpool. Carrying her gloves, bucket and sponge, 72-year-old Joan Lingard was cleaning the stadium’s seats by 9am on Tuesday. It would be “absolutely awful” for Bury if its club disappeared, she said. “Everybody’s come down, whether they come to the matches or not. I’d hate to see it go. Next to Bury black puddings, this is the next thing, Gigg Lane. The two are synonymous.” Ian Frazer, 48, a Leeds fan, joined the clean-up, motivated by the financial crisis experienced by his own club 12 years ago. Wearing a Leeds shirt while scrubbing pigeon droppings off Bury’s Manchester Road stand, Frazer said: “It’s simple stuff like this that’s fantastic to see – all the kids here. I kind of welled up when I got here. “It’s very, very moving in many ways. To see this reaction from Bury supporters, from people who live in the town who maybe aren’t football fans. This is a tremendous outpouring of community spirit. I’ll be honest, out of adversity over the last few weeks and months this town has really shown its strength.”"

But have we been blessed with the new Nadiya? Chitra Ramaswamy Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.30 BST On your marks, get set … GET HAPPY! The Great British Bake Off – the show that brought the nation together at the exact same time everything else fell in the bin like a sabotaged baked alaska – is 10 years old. To celebrate, we get … another scrumptious series of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4). No surprises hidden like currants in a fruit cake. No crimes or misdemeanours (not yet anyway). No boat-rocking channel switches. Just some decent folk getting in a tizzy over the height of their genoise in a Berkshire tent. Let’s face it, reviewing Bake Off is now about as necessary as scoring your nan’s scones. Of course they’re going to be just right, you ungrateful wretch. Nevertheless, like those scones, Bake Off commands attention, praise, respect. And we show this recognition not by making ‘mmmm’ noises and saying ‘your best yet, nan’ but via the cooking up of vast amounts of column inches, manufactured scandals, and thinkpieces on what it really means when Paul Hollywood describes Michelle’s Fairy House showstopper as “faultless” yet doesn’t give her the handshake. Is it unconscious bias? Because it’s the first episode and he doesn’t want to peak too soon? Or has the handshake been overused to the point of redundancy and will now only be rolled out in the event of another bread lion? We will never know, but I’m racing ahead when what we’re after is a low-and-slow bake. So to the opening tableau; a riff on The Wizard of Oz. Noel Fielding, droll, kind, cheeky-faced, is Dorothy. Sandy Toksvig is the scarecrow with no brain (Noel: “That’s the QI gig gone!”). Prue Leith – she of the showstopper necklaces and compassionate judging – is the lion. And Hollywood is the tin man. No heart. “Is it weird that I fancy you now?” Toksvig asks Fielding as they wander across the lawn and we wait for the theme, the aural equivalent of stepping into a warm bath, to kick in. “So do I,” mutters Hollywood. Hil. Ar. I. Ous. It’s cake week, and the signature challenge is a fruit cake, which is all about batter consistency. Too thin and the fruit drops to the bottom, too thick and … whatevs. What we’re really interested in is the texture of the contestants. Will we be blessed with a Nadiya or Rahul? Who’s going to be the anal Brendan-y one? (Henry, without a doubt: just look at his royal iced house). The posh one who induces automatic fond eye-rolls whenever they mention using pullet eggs from their own chickens? (A toss-up between vet Rosie and geography teacher Alice). The clumsy one? (Michael: he keeps cutting himself but still makes a treasure chest cake with about three fingers.) As all Bake Off fans know, the ideal contestant will be the perfect cake mix of wit, compassion, baking flair, self-deprecation, team spirit, and comedy stress responses. It’s too early to say, but I’m keeping an eye on Steph and Michelle. Much has been made of how young the group is this year, and it’s true that seven out of 13 are in their 20s. Jamie, 20, is easily the silliest. One of those inexplicable people who looks like he’s having the best time even while failing to add eggs to his caramel schnauzer. “It’s like mixing concrete,” he grins. Special mention, also, to Helena, who “lives like every day is Halloween” and makes the droopiest bat wings ever crafted out of sugar. “From one goth to another I know you’ll be fine,” Fielding reassures her. God love him, and all goths who bake. Her genoise is so rubbery, she says, that if it fell on the floor it would bounce right back. Tragically, this doesn’t happen. But her showstopper leads to the episode’s best moment. Based on the fairy garden Helena imagined as a child, she explains that she now has an actual fairy garden at home. Hollywood looks a bit smirky. Turns out he thought she said furry garden. Oooooh, naughty! “Oh Paul,” says Helena, slightly hysterical. “I know what you’re thinking.” Cue a query about how big her furry garden is, at which point I started to miss Mary Berry, because her confused-amused face would have been priceless.No matter. Bake Off remains a constant in this otherwise sugar-free life. A place where catastrophe is a dropped cake that can always be squashed back together. Welcome home, nan."

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 10.44 BST Major fires are burning this week in south-central Alaska, lengthening the state’s wildfire season, which has usually ended by the beginning of August. They come after Alaska’s hottest July on record, during which its largest city, Anchorage, had a temperature pass 90F (32C) for the first time. On top of that, the area has seen little rain this summer, resulting in extremely dry conditions. As firefighters tackle the blazes, officials are facing the longer term challenges of keeping the region safe amid increasing evidence of the impacts of the climate crisis. Everything points to more fires, longer fire seasons and more intense fires Wildfires are a growing concern around the country. According to the latest National Climate Assessment, hotter, drier conditions over the past two decades have led to more area being burned across the US. To make matters more perilous, since the 1990s, many millions of homes around the country have been built in or near forested areas, such as in the town of Paradise, California, the scene of a deadly wildfire last year. In Anchorage, which has a population of around 294,000, a few small fires have broken out within the city limits this summer. While much less destructive than this week’s blazes in the south-central region, they gave officials notice of a growing new threat inside the city. “Alaska residents in 2019 have dealt with more fire prone conditions, have dealt with more smoke, and have generally been more concerned and more aware of fire conditions,” said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “They are wondering if this is a glimpse of a future, warmer Anchorage,” Brettschneider said. Around 80 miles north of Anchorage, the over over 3700-acre (1500 hectare) McKinley Fire, which started over the weekend, continues to blaze. No casualties have been reported yet, but the fire has destroyed an estimated 80 structures so far. Many people living along the highway between Anchorage and Denali National Park have been forced to evacuate. Four other significant wildfires are also burning in the region surrounding Anchorage, choking the city with smoke. This week, the nearby Chugach Mountains were all but obscured from view, and the city health department issued advisories warning of unhealthy air conditions. Anchorage itself experienced a fire scare in early July, heralded by a plume of smoke rising from a wooded area on the east side of the city. Firefighters rushed to the scene and soon reported 60ft (18m) flames leaping from a black spruce forest. Helicopters and air tankers zoomed in to douse the quickly spreading blaze with water and fire retardant. Nearby homes were evacuated. Crews managed to contain the fire and in this case, no homes were lost. “It was scary,” said John See, a forester with the Anchorage Fire Department. “It was a really high priority fire, in a bad place.” This summer’s wildfires are taking place amidst unusual conditions, to put it mildly. The July fire in Anchorage broke out at the start of what the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association described as “a period of warmth that re-wrote the record books” in Alaska. High temperatures persisted through August and little rain fell. Combined with especially high winds early this week, conditions were perfect for wildfires, worsening blazes that were already burning and stoking new ones. For the Anchorage area “the risk has always been there, but the risk is magnified tremendously,” said climate scientist Brettschneider. This is the result of multiple factors, he said. Alaska’s fire season is usually earlier than the season in the contiguous US, taking place in late spring and early summer. Humidity is lowest, as well as it being the driest and windiest time of year. What usually helps mitigate those conditions, Brettschneider said, is lingering snow cover. But due to global heating, snow in the Anchorage area is melting earlier, extending the length of the season. And as temperatures go up, conditions are getting even drier. “Everything points to more fires, longer fire seasons and more intense fires,” said Brettschneider. “There is no silver lining.” As the Arctic warms twice as fast as the rest of the planet, Alaska as a whole is feeling the climate crisis more acutely than many other US states. Scientists are seeing indications that whole ocean ecosystems are being upended. In rural Alaska, frozen rivers used for wintertime travel are melting early, endangering lives. And the combination of thawing permafrost and coastal storms is forcing whole villages to relocate. In addition to wildfires, the city of Anchorage is trying to prepare for a laundry list of other near and long-term issues, outlined in the Climate Action Plan the city adopted this spring. More frequent freeze-thaw events in winter are transforming the city’s streets and sidewalks into skating rinks. Biologists fear that rising temperatures could lead to the arrival of winter ticks, threatening Anchorage’s ubiquitous population of urban moose. The city is also keeping a close eye on the retreat of the nearby Eklutna Glacier, which provides the bulk of Anchorage’s drinking water supply and is expected to disappear in 100 years or less. But when it comes to the immediate risk to public safety, wildfires rank “pretty darn high,” said Shaina Kilcoyne, energy and sustainability manager for the municipality of Anchorage. “Anchorage is surrounded by forested areas, and we’ve got a large population that is connected to those areas,” said Kilcoyne. “This is definitely a big threat for Anchorage residents, and it is something that the municipality is taking very seriously.” After what we’ve experienced this summer, it does make you wonder what’s ahead of us. Is this going to be the norm? In addition to the threat to human health and safety, fighting and recovering from wildfires can come with a hefty price tag. A recent report from the University of Alaska’s Institute of Social and Economic Research projected that due to increased climate risk, wildfires could cost the state an additional $25-$40m per year over the next three to five decades. The research did not provide estimates for individual Alaska cities, but co-author Jennifer Schmidt said it’s unlikely that Anchorage will be immune to increased wildfire costs. Schmidt, who is leading the Urban Forest and Watersheds working group under Anchorage’s Climate Action Plan, said looking at increased wildfire risk through the lens of climate change is important. The severity of Alaska’s wildfire seasons can be erratic year-to-year, Schmidt said, but large fire years are increasing statewide. “It’s an overall trend and we have to take a long term vision,” said Schmidt. Anchorage is taking steps to deal with the problem. Anchorage forester See is in charge of coordinating the city’s wildfire mitigation program, and spends a lot of time helping homes and neighborhoods reduce their risk through the Firewise program. See advises residents to thin trees around their houses, install non-combustible roofs and make sure emergency crews are able to easily access their neighborhoods. See estimates the city has completed work on nearly 3,000 homes, but there are many more at risk. “We’ve scratched the surface,” said See. “You can take a drive on the hillside and see just hundreds of homes that really need Firewise.” This summer’s conditions in the area surrounding the city have highlighted the urgency of the situation. “After what we’ve experienced this summer, it does make you wonder what’s ahead of us. Is this going to be the norm?” said See. “And if it is, then boy, we really need to do some different things here.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter "
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/16/missy-mazzoli-breaking-the-waves-deals-with-big-ideas-opera-is-a-place-for-big-ideas,"Adapting Lars von Trier’s provocative 1996 film about faith and loyalty in an insular Scottish community was the first challenge. Bringing it to Scotland is the next Fri 16 Aug 2019 11.00 BST


Last modified on Mon 19 Aug 2019 10.17 BST Breaking the Waves is one of the most brutal, probing and provocative films ever made about Scotland. It is also one of the most impressively silent. Lars von Trier’s 1996 breakthrough portrays an insular Hebridean community that is fiercely defensive of its values in the face of incomers and offshore oil development. The elders wield religious dogma in an attempt to protect a young woman, Bess McNeill, but their efforts pivot into tyranny and their fear turns xenophobic. Bess, played with galling vividness by Emily Watson, marries an oil worker called Jan. He becomes paralysed after an accident on the rig and instructs Bess to keep their relationship alive by having sex with other men and then telling him about it. Von Trier shows it all in bleak, intimate and savagely quiet detail. With the exception of chapter interludes charged with 1970s rock (Procol Harum, Roxy Music, Elton John), there is no music underscoring the austere camerawork. We feel the silent scrutiny of an island that has no bells in its church steeple: the elders removed them, believing them a distraction from God. What happens when you add sound to such formidably oppressive filmic hush? The New York composer Missy Mazzoli has spent years grappling with that question. “Back in 2013,” she says, “my librettist, Royce Vavrek, suggested making an opera out of Breaking the Waves. I said absolutely not: I thought the film was untouchable. But it was a question that wouldn’t leave me alone. The film deals with big ideas about the nature of loyalty, the nature of faith. Opera is a place for big ideas.” We are speaking at the rehearsal studios of Scottish Opera, whose new production of Mazzoli’s acclaimed work opens in Edinburgh next week. The film is actually packed with classic operatic trademarks. The devoted, mistreated woman – a fixture of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini. The woman who sacrifices herself for the salvation of a man – Wagner’s redemptive heroines. The seething small-community groupthink to a backdrop of menacing, hallowed seascapes – think Peter Grimes. Mazzoli recognises the weight of that lineage but her broad, brooding post-minimalism carries it lightly. Mazzoli is a star of the US contemporary classical mainstream. She plays in the Brooklyn band Victoire, which she founded to champion her own work, and is composer-in-residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She studied with Bang on a Can co-founder David Lang, and shares his knack for lushness cut with sparsity, propulsion studded with unmissable emotive triggers. She tells me that opera thrills her most – that she always wrote instrumental music in a dramatic way, “thinking of instruments as characters, sometimes in opposition to each other, sometimes together, but always with personality. So the leap to opera was natural. It felt like something I’d been waiting for, nothing short of meeting my destiny.” When Opera Philadelphia commissioned Breaking the Waves for its 2016 season, she took a trip to Scotland with Vavrek. “We didn’t know why it was important until we got here and immersed ourselves in the Isle of Skye,” she says. “It overtook me like waves.” Von Trier shot much of his film on Skye, though his setting is an invention: there are no oil rigs on the Scottish west coast, but the religion of the film points to the Hebrides. For Mazzoli, that sense of place is key. References to Skye are, she says, “delicious in the music”. Her ears pricked up at the accents – “a gift for vocal lines! This one man spoke about being ‘hefted to the hill’. I could hear the music of that phrase instantly.” She also asked locals about their experience of Scottish Free Presbyterianism in the 70s. One woman recalled the walk to church every Sunday, with the whole village noting who did or did not attend. Above all, Mazzoli’s creative mind was set racing by the landscape. “Rare for me,” she admits. “Ninety-nine percent of my work is inspired by human drama, the inner life of interesting people. But the very first chord in the opera is a direct response to a place called The Brother’s Point. A lush meadow, sheep grazing, then a sharp point dropping off into a cliff and waves crashing. That combination of soft and rough – it’s a landscape that’s almost sexy in its lushness. I knew the music had to start like that. The vibe of it was crystal clear.” She is nervous about bringing the opera to Scotland – “There’s nothing worse than an American telling people what their country is like” – and stresses that although the music is thick with Hebridean atmosphere, it is not a portrait of anywhere. “In portraying the religious men, we’re not making a statement about the men of Skye. We’re making a statement about the patriarchy of religion.” Not for the last time, Von Trier’s film attracted controversy for its extreme scenes of humiliating sex and female debasement. Does Bess suffer for the benefit of Jan’s fantasies and – ultimately – for our entertainment? Mazzoli doesn’t see it that way. “A lot of people talk about his treatment of actresses. I’m not interested in that. I’ve never met the man. The point for me is that I don’t think this film is misogynist. There’s an interesting ambiguity in Jan’s motivations but I believe his motivation is pure. It has to be a true love story.” Mazzoli says she has not written a feminist opera – “It’s preoccupied with other themes” – but describes it as the story of a woman “in an impossible situation. Everyone around her is telling her what to do and how to act. And they’re all telling her contradictory things. They’re punishing her for falling off the line of acceptable behaviour, which in reality is impossibly thin. As a woman, I can definitely relate to that. It’s how I feel, and to a greater extent how all the older women in my family have felt. The old madonna/whore thing: you’re supposed to be pure, but you’re also supposed to please men through your body. You can’t win because you’re either a slut or a prude. You’re constantly falling on either side of the line.” Von Trier called it a story about goodness – what can go wrong even when everyone tries to act in a way they believe to be right. Watching the film, it is hard to feel compassion towards the elders of the community – and that is where Mazzoli hopes her music can contribute nuance. While the church councilman berates Bess with cruel words, Mazzoli writes him lush cascading lines. “I can shade every word in one direction or the other. It’s why I love opera. I can contradict what’s assumed.” Above all, her music lets us into Bess’s head. More than that: in a sense, Bess conjures the whole opera. Her community is silent, but she loves music. “Maybe she is music,” Mazzoli suggests. So while we might expect those rough waves and gentle meadows to come from the orchestra, instead Mazzoli gives us a sumptuous electronic soundscape that emerges from the ether. It is as if we are hearing Bess’s unbridled imagination, and only when the music spills into the pit and is taken up by the instruments do we come crashing down to earth. It is a tremendously powerful idea – an operatically transfigurative idea – as if the entire work, the entire genre, becomes the spirit Bess can’t set free in the film. If ever Mazzoli was concerned about what opera might add to Von Trier’s supernatural epic, here is the answer. •Breaking the Waves is at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh, 21-24 August, part of Edinburgh international festival."

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 09.37 BST Bolton have been given 14 days to complete a sale of the club or be expelled from the English Football League by an EFL board which expressed its frustration with a drawn-out takeover process which fell apart at the weekend. The EFL’s statement was issued at 11pm on Tuesday, at the same time as the expulsion of Bolton’s neighbours Bury was announced, demonstrating the very real threat facing Wanderers, one of the league’s founder members in 1888. The club’s administrator, Paul Appleton, had himself expressed his exasperation with the owner, Ken Anderson, naming him in a statement as the only party to the planned sale to Football Ventures who had not signed the deal on Friday. Appleton said that “devastatingly” the deal had collapsed on Saturday morning, understood to be over the terms of Anderson’s release from the club and any remaining borrowings, although Anderson denied that he was responsible for the delay. While a further statement was issued on Tuesday before a 5pm deadline issued by the EFL, it said only that discussions were ongoing. Following a board meeting by telephone, which began at 5pm, the EFL issued the 14-day notice. “Despite further exchanges with the administrators over the course of the Bank Holiday weekend and right up until today’s deadline of 5pm, a resolution to the ongoing impasse in negotiations regarding a completion of sale at Bolton Wanderers has not yet been found,” the statement said. Bolton have until 11:59pm on 12 September to conclude the sale, or show that it can be funded through a full season in administration – which Appleton himself has said is not practicable. In a further statement the EFL’s executive chair, Debbie Jevans, said: “Despite repeated assurances, we are extremely disappointed that we are still not in a position to reach a successful resolution with the sale of Bolton Wanderers and have therefore taken the decision to [issue the notice of withdrawal]. I again urge all parties to finalise the proposed takeover.” Appleton had warned on Monday that a failure by Anderson and the other parties to agree a deal could lead to “the process of closing down the company” beginning on Wednesday. In response to the EFL’s 14-day notice, Appleton’s firm, David Rubin and partners, issued a statement on the club’s website which read: “All parties have been in continuous dialogue throughout the day and are working closely together this evening in order to bring a deal to completion. We will continue to work through the night if necessary.”"

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.55 BST If Bolton Wanderers were to fold, it would be devastating. In provincial towns the football club is at the centre. Also there are jobs at stake and I remember what it felt like in the great times: the sense of euphoria and positivity that was sent through the town can’t be overestimated. To lose that would be tragic. I first went to see Bolton after being asked to take my younger brother to a football match. This was in 1978, I was coming up 14, it was under duress and yet I decided I quite liked it and have been a fan ever since. It was a cup game against Arsenal – my dad wasn’t into football, so we did it of our own volition. But it was a boy’s thing then really, which sounds daft now, so I didn’t go regularly until I moved to London, which was a bit random. I got a season ticket in 1994 and started coming back up to Bolton, when the club still played at Burnden Park, before we moved to the new stadium in 1997. On a match day it was certainly vibrant and alive but Burnden Park was rough and ready: it was the old days, standing on the terraces: you thought you’d got yourself a good spot, then somebody would plop themselves in front of you. Then there were all the stanchions blocking the view. People can have rose-tinted spectacles about the past but I was so happy that we moved because there were no proper facilities there. My favourite player is not actually one who would jump out to most: I really liked Gudni Bergsson, though there were so many that came through in that period: Jay‑Jay Okocha, Youri Djorkaeff, Ivan Campo, Fernando Hierro – just unprecedented times. You thought how on earth has Sam Allardyce – who was manager from 1999-2007 – persuaded these people to come to Bolton but he did. That was great but the Bruce Rioch era, from 1995 to 1998, was really good for me as well because that was built up from more UK‑based players so it felt more local. It wasn’t all glamour, not people at the end of their career – we were cultivating our own people. But now I just feel really worried sick; it’s all a bit surreal. Who is to blame? It goes back further than Ken Anderson, who has been owner since March 2016. To me Anderson is definitely to blame but the writing was on the wall when it was Phil Gartside, chairman from 1999 to 2015, to be honest. There didn’t seem to be any checks and balances, it was a closed shop, nobody got to know what was going on behind the scenes. It felt as if they just ruled everything between them, and you just think: where on earth did the money go? All those seasons in the Premier League, where did it all go? You just can’t believe we’ve ended up in the situation where we are. It was bad management and kicking the can down the road, and not investing in the future, not being frugal. Anderson should have been nowhere near our club. He’s got a track record – he was banned from being a company director for eight years, but the EFL sanctioned it. It was just ridiculous – he shouldn’t have been allowed anywhere near it, as I said from day one. Some sections of the fans thought we’d been saved by someone coming in at the last moment when we’d been in court and we were going to be wound up in 2016. People talked like he was the saviour but look at his track record – I always felt it could only go one way. Sure enough, three and a half years later it has. I rate the chances of survival now at 50-50 but I don’t think it is in anyone’s interest for the club to go into liquidation, so I just hope an 11th-hour a deal is going to be done. • Maggie Tetlow is a Bolton fan and a board member of the supporters’ trust"

Last modified on Mon 12 Aug 2019 20.00 BST Alexander Albon, the British-Thai driver, has been promoted to the Red Bull Formula One team and will make his first appearance for them in the next round at Spa. In an unexpected decision, the 23-year-old still in his debut F1 season, will replace Pierre Gasly, who has been demoted into Albon’s seat with Red Bull’s sister squad Toro Rosso having underperformed so far this season. Albon has competed in 12 races with Toro Rosso this season and impressed while Gasly has not in what is his first year with Red Bull. After the last round in Hungary, Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner said there was no intent to replace the Frenchman. However, he did also note that Gasly had not been “in the mix at all”. Indeed, Gasly has not only been way off the pace of his teammate Max Verstappen but of other drivers around him. He has 63 points to Verstappen’s 181 and is only five points in front of McLaren’s Carlos Sainz, who is driving a car demonstrably not as quick as the Red Bull. It will not be lost on Red Bull that last season they opted to bring Gasly rather than Sainz into their team. Verstappen has won two of the last four races and Red Bull are genuinely in a fight with Ferrari for second place. They trail the Scuderia by just 44 points. Gasly’s best finish this season was fourth at Silverstone. Crucially, he has not been able to play a part in a team role supporting Verstappen. Albon, who was third in last years F2 championship, has 16 points. He produced outstanding performances to go from last to tenth at the Chinese Grand Prix and took sixth from 17th on the grid in treacherous wet conditions at the Hockenheimring. Red Bull might have promoted Daniil Kvyat to the seat but the Russian already raced for them in 2015-16 before he was similarly demoted to make room for Verstappen. The team know what he can do so are now assessing Albon before making a decision on who will join Verstappen next year. “Red Bull are in the unique position of having four talented Formula 1 drivers under contract who can be rotated between Aston Martin Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso,” said a statement. “The team will use the next nine races to evaluate Alex’s performance in order to make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max in 2020.”"

Test centurion Franks has paid for deteriorating form this year and won’t contest his third tournament, having being part of the victorious teams of 2011 and 2015. Coach Steve Hansen also dropped a surprise in his loose forward mix, where Chiefs flanker Luke Jacobson is included despite having played just one Test, off the bench against Argentina last month. Lock Brodie Retallick was also included despite suffering a dislocated shoulder against South Africa last month, as was midfield back Ryan Crotty, who has been out of action for the last two months with a broken thumb. Nine players will be going to their second tournament, while 19 are going to their first. “The selectors wanted to point out that it wasn’t a case of anyone not being good enough to be selected, but more the fact that we can only take 31, so there was always go to be some very talented athletes that would miss out,” Hansen said. “Having said that, as we know from previous Rugby World Cups and other campaigns, we may have injuries so those players who missed out may get an opportunity.” The All Blacks kick off their campaign against South Africa in Yokahama on 21 September before meeting Canada, Namibia and Italy in the remainder of their pool games. Backs: Ben Smith, Rieko Ioane, Jordie Barrett, George Bridge, Sevu Reece, Ryan Crotty, Sonny Bill Williams, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, Beauden Barrett, Richie Mo’unga, Aaron Smith, TJ Perenara, Brad Weber.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.36 BST Last week in the Guardian, I commended those of a bookish turn of mind to surrender themselves to the BBC’s 10-hour adaptation of Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, broadcast over the bank holiday weekend on Radio 4. I had reckoned without the cricket, but even so, long weekends are, well, pretty long. So did the series deliver on its promise to transport us, like the narrator himself, back to the riverside at Combray and the salons of Paris? One of the central issues that faced dramatist Timberlake Wertenbaker and director and producer Celia de Wolff was how to balance the unparalleled sense of longueur of Proust’s vast roman-fleuve and the recollection of dramatic, frequently fruity incident. It is easier – and perhaps especially so in the grammar of radio – to convey dinner-party repartee than moments of reflection, even when they are performed by the measured, deliberate Derek Jacobi. Thus the ear was drawn more naturally to, for example, Frances Barber’s conspiratorial Madame Verdurin as she gossiped and plotted and decided who was in or out of her social circle. Equally tricky to pull off is the layering of a man in old age summoning up the confusion of the adult behaviour he witnesses in childhood – in our narrator’s case, the social hierarchies embodied by the aristocratic Guermantes family and the unwisely married Swann, which he dimly apprehends but whose import and nuance he naturally misses. “Greedy for happiness,” he muses in later life, of his would-be friendship with the Duchesse de Guermantes (played here by Fenella Woolgar), “I asked nothing more from life in those moments than that it should consist always of a series of happy afternoons”. But life is not always anything, and nor can happy afternoons dispel the other lives that the child experiences, perhaps most notably, and strongly present in this adaptation, the anguish and fear he feels when he is separated from his mother, “his sad evenings and wakeful nights”. Childhood agonies give way to a broader sweep of desires and losses as Combray recedes and the seaside town of Balbec and boulevards of Paris arrive; and when the cast of characters enlarges to include the narrator’s love objects, Gilberte (Emma Mackey) and Albertine (Hattie Morahan), Swann himself (Paterson Joseph) and the rakish, libidinous Baron de Charlus, played with gusto by Simon Russell Beale. It was an intriguing 10 hours, brought together with care and expertise, but what did it amount to? There was a sense, for me, that to take on such a mammoth work, now often used as a byword for something hard to attempt, needed a more innovative approach to truly hold listeners either unfamiliar with the work altogether, or so immersed in it that they didn’t need to be reminded of, as it were, its greatest hits. I would, perhaps, have dispensed with the background sounds of strings, and realistic sound effects of tinkling laughter and glasses clinking, and gone for something fresher and more unexpected. But the words were still there; and if one treats this adaptation as an introduction and companion to Proust’s characters and most pressing themes, it is well worth a listen."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.05 BST Sheila Steafel, who has died aged 84, was a versatile and bewitching character actor with an outstanding gift for comic timing. As well as being the regular female cast member on the landmark satirical television show The Frost Report (1966-67) – alongside the emerging talents of John Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett – she played opposite, “and sometimes against”, in her words, many of the leading TV comedians of the day, including Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (in Not Only … But Also, 1965), Roy Hudd, Tommy Cooper, Spike Milligan and Kenny Everett. After the success of The Frost Report, a winner of the Golden Rose of Montreux, she was in demand for guest parts in comedy series. Regular roles included Ivy Watkins in the Granada sitcom How’s Your Father (1974-75), the White Lady in all three series of Richard Carpenter’s charming comedy The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78), and the imperious literary agent supporting debut novelist Diane Keen as she starts to overshadow Tim Brooke-Taylor in the sitcom You Must Be the Husband (1987-88). But while she was a game comic foil on TV, she shone as a stage performer in one-woman shows at the Edinburgh festival and various London theatres. In The Late Sheila Steafel (1981), Steafel Solo (1982), Steafel XPress (1985) and Victoria Plums (1995) she delivered comic songs and monologues supplied by writers including Keith Waterhouse, Barry Cryer, David Nobbs, Andy Hamilton and Dick Vosburgh. Her features were distinctive, and she deployed them to comedic advantage. Her lidded eyes could be languidly seductive or quizzically innocent, her brows could arch sardonically while her face remained still, and a wry kink in her lips could curl into a feline smile, accentuated by her high cheekbones. Vocally dextrous but also a fine physical clown, she created Miss Popsy Wopsy, a woozy, klutzy ingenue – a music hall entertainer who was never quite on note and always just behind the beat. She performed the character in her shows and several times on TV in The Good Old Days in the 1970s and 80s. In person she could deliver drawled witticisms and deadpan putdowns, making her a jolly addition to panel shows such as Juke Box Jury, Call My Bluff and Blankety Blank. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, Sheila was the younger of two children of Harold, a garage owner from Lancashire, and his wife, Eda (nee Cohen). There was little professional theatre, but Harold directed and performed in amateur productions, particularly of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the young Sheila would watch from the wings. Her mother was a talented pianist and so her childhood was surrounded by drama and music. She also sang at the local synagogue, where both Harold and Eda were involved in directing the choir. She was educated at Barnato Park school, not far from her home in the middle-class suburb of Berea, and narrowly avoided being expelled for writing a risqué pantomime. At Witwatersrand University she studied fine art, but abandoned the course to travel to Britain to audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London in 1953. She did a term at its preparatory academy, but was told she was unusual and would probably have to wait until she was in her 30s and become a character actor. Undeterred, she enrolled instead at the Webber Douglas Academy, where she won the Margaret Rutherford award for comedy. After graduation and stints in repertory theatre in Blackpool and Lincoln, in 1959 she worked as an usherette at the Players’ theatre, Charing Cross, which presented Victorian music hall shows, and eventually plucked up the courage to ask for an audition. She passed, and while there honed her comedy skills, created Miss Popsy Wopsy and began to get noticed. Her first West End opportunity came in 1961, when she took over the role of Barbara opposite Tom Courtenay in Billy Liar, directed by Lindsay Anderson. In 1972 she played opposite Robert Morley in How the Other Half Loves at the Lyric theatre, and she was cast as a female Harpo Marx in A Day in Hollywood, A Night in the Ukraine (New End theatre, 1979), at the insistence of Vosburgh, its writer. She won rave reviews. She was a memorably eccentric, hip-flask swigging Mistress Quickly in an RSC production of The Merry Wives of Windsor (1985), played Meg in the Birthday Party at the Bristol Old Vic (2006) and carried on to the last performance despite needing spinal surgery when playing Mrs Brice in Funny Girl at the Minerva theatre, Chichester (2008). Her films included Daleks Invasion Earth 2150AD (1966), Quatermass and the Pit (1967) and the rather less earnest Bloodbath at the House of Death (1984), with Everett and Vincent Price, and co-written by Cryer. On radio she was a regular cast member of the topical comedy show Weekending (1977-82), was to be heard in plays and readings, and performed in her own vehicles Steafel Plus (1982) and Steafel with an S (1984). In later years she made character appearances in popular TV series such as Doctors (with seven different roles between 2005 and 2016) and Holby City (three between 2007 and 2016). In 1958 she married the actor Harry H Corbett. After their divorce in 1964 she had various relationships but did not marry again. She described their time together, and her career, in her autobiography, When Harry Met Sheila (2010), and also published a series of short anecdotal stories based on real life encounters entitled Bastards (2012). • Sheila Frances Steafel, actor and comedian, born 26 May 1935; died 23 August 2019"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.44 BST Just before he died at his Oxford home in December 1945, Otto Neurath said something lovely to his third wife, Marie. The philosopher had been reading an article on the subject of happiness, when he turned to her and said: “I can tell you what I mean by happiness. If godfather would come to me and say: ‘Dear Otto, I make you an offer as you are living now with your books and your work and your wife. You can live for ever and ever but you will never be more prosperous than you are now. Will you accept?’ ‘Yes, dear godfather. I gladly accept.’” Marie and Otto were Viennese refugees from Nazism, he a Jew denounced as a communist, she an Aryan whose maiden name was Reidemeister. They fled fascism in 1934, first to the Netherlands and later to the UK where they were interned during the war for a while as enemy aliens. The Neuraths were creative revolutionaries who shared a utopian vision, one in which contentment could be achieved through a simplified visual language. In 1935, Marie came up with the acronym Isotype (International System of Typographic Picture Education) to refer to the pictographic language they were developing that would educate children through visual icons and visible chains of reasoning. They had been inspired by the English philosopher Charles Kay Ogden, who proposed that English could be boiled down to 850 words. The language, called Basic, could be learned in days and, he hoped, would pave the way to peace by reversing the curse of Babel. Their Isotype Institute, founded in Vienna, had the slogan: “Words divide, pictures unite.” In hindsight, they were communication pioneers in that their new visual language pre-empted emojis. But while Otto has long been celebrated as a philosopher and social reformer, the work of Marie has been relatively neglected – until now. London’s House of Illustration has a beguiling little show called Marie Neurath: Picturing Science, celebrating her work at the Isotype Institute until her own death in London in 1986. From her husband’s death until the 1970s, she led a team of illustrators who produced more than 80 children’s books, half of them devoted to science education. It is not so much the question of how to transfer in the most direct way some knowledge, but how to satisfy the possible questions of a child The beautiful books on show at the exhibition – among them Too Small to See, Inside the Atom and Railways under London – were modelled on Otto’s conviction that data pictorially organised could say more than words. In a 1944 typescript explaining the value of Isotype books exhibited in the show, he wrote: “There are many fine books, giving information to adults and children, but usually they are ‘learned’. These Isotype books try to avoid that … It is not so much the question of how to transfer in the most direct and simple way some knowledge, but how to satisfy the possible questions of a child, his love of action, his identifying himself with a person on the page.” As a child, Otto had been fascinated by Egyptian hieroglyphics, not just their forms but how they communicated a story. While the narrative of human progress usually has hieroglyphics as way station to sophisticated written and verbal communication (the British Library’s current superb show on writing suggests as much), Otto held on to the value of simple rule-based combinations of symbols and colours, particularly to graphically show complex data in easily graspable ways. After the first world war, he was inspired in developing this visual language by Soviet constructivism and the German Bauhaus, and sharing their minimalist aesthetics and utopian, modernist spirit. At the time, Otto was working as director of the Museum of City Planning in what was known as Red Vienna, the post-first world war era from 1918 to 1934 when the city became a crucible for socialist living. The museum’s purpose was to educate the Viennese public about postwar social housing and at exhibitions he would showcase a symbol-based language as an alternative to written language. It was there that he met Marie, a physicist, mathematician and art-school graduate who became what they called a “transformer” – an intermediary between data collectors (historians, statisticians and economists) and graphic artists. Today, she would have been called a graphic designer. Indeed, without the Neuraths, graphic design as we know it might not have existed. As the project grew, Otto hired artists including Erwin Bernath and Gerd Arntz, for what would become known as the Isotype Institute. Along with Marie, they pioneered the professional design of a visual language for the public communication of historical and statistical information. At the same time as working in the museum and developing the Isotype Institute, Otto was becoming an eminent philosopher, a leading member of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists and tilting at the Marxist Jews of the Frankfurt School, whose scorn for scientific progress and Enlightenment values he loathed. Indeed, the Isotype Institute was a self-conscious continuation of the Enlightenment’s most resonant project: 18th-century French philosophers’ attempt to promote the advancement of science and secular thought through an illustrated encyclopaedia. Once exiled from Austria, the Neuraths became even more ambitious. They created the International Foundation for Visual Education in The Hague, and spearheaded the international Unity of Science movement that launched a project called the Encyclopedia of Unified Science, aimed at using pictorial languages to proselytise for international scientific and social cooperation – a beautiful idea, if one effectively eliminated by the increasing darkness of the times. But while Red Vienna remains architecturally renowned for such imposing blocks as the Karl Marx Hof and the Rabenhof, featuring communal facilities such as bathhouses, laundries, kindergartens, libraries and even kitchens, Otto Neurath backed a different solution for a housing revolution. In 1934, he and Marie oversaw the opening of a workers’ association housing complex (Werkbundsliedung), an estate of 70 houses in south-west Vienna that offered working-class families the opportunity to purchase or rent homes designed by a diverse group of 31 international architects, including Adolf Loos. A decade later, the Neuraths were invited to work in Bilston in the Black Country. Like Vienna after the first world war, Bilston after the second world war – a town of 31,000 – desperately needed new housing. After hearing Otto lecture on Vienna in Wolverhampton, Bilston’s town clerk invited the socialist philosopher to help. Williams was impressed by his humane vision: “He made one believe in the dignity of human beings.” As Neurath wrote: “On estates, mix up individuals: married and unmarried, old and young. Do not create ghettos of, for example, old people who, if they are stuck altogether in flats, will feel isolated, lonely and unwanted. If you put them in with young people, they can do things like babysitting and feel useful and wanted.” Again, a beautiful dream, too rarely realised. But, just as the rise of Austrian fascism scotched the Neuraths’ dreams of a Viennese socialist paradise, so Otto’s early death thwarted the couple’s plan to make Bilston happy. While the estate still exists, it’s scarcely the socialist paradise they hoped to create. More happily, Marie carried on the work of the Isotype Institute, focusing on rendering complex scientific ideas in visual form. Many of the results can be seen in this exhibition and they’re unexpectedly beautiful as well as instructive. Though the books on display were created for children, I found them unbelievably helpful. In fact, epiphany followed epiphany as I stood for long minutes realising for the first time how bread is made, how insects pollinate plants and how volcanoes work. Later, I spent even happier minutes elbowing small children aside at the activity table where I was tasked with numbering in the right order the pictures showing what happens in a bird’s egg, based on four frames from a children’s book that shows Marie at her best – explaining complex concepts in easily understood ways. Co-curator Katie Nairne argues that Marie Neurath’s “groundbreaking approach has had a huge impact on contemporary design and infographics and deserves much greater acclaim than it currently receives”. Now, 33 years after her death, she is finally getting it. • Marie Neurath: Picturing Science is at House of Illustration, London, until 3 November."

Last modified on Sat 10 Aug 2019 17.45 BST An activist who was assaulted, tortured and imprisoned for three years for criticising the Formula One race in Bahrain has been freed by authorities today. Najah Yusuf, a former Bahraini civil servant and mother of four children, was jailed in April 2017 after she criticised the race and the regime on Facebook. Yusuf was pardoned under a concession ahead of the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha, which takes place on Sunday, and is the first political prisoner to be released since 2011. Her family received a phone call from Isa Town prison in Bahrain to confirm Yusuf could go home. The Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) has led an international campaign to secure Yusuf’s freedom, which peaked during Bahrain’s Grand Prix in March this year. Yusuf wrote a first-person account of her experience for the Guardian in March, in which she declared: “Every moment I spend in prison in Bahrain stains the reputation of Formula One.” In it, she detailed shocking abuse and sexual assault at the hands of officers. Initially, Formula One bosses admitted to having “concerns” about Yusuf’s case, but in a letter to Bird and Human Rights Watch in March, it said it had been assured Yusuf’s conviction “had nothing to do with peaceful protest around the Bahrain Grand Prix”. The Bahrain government also promised: “Anyone who merely criticised or continues to criticise Formula 1 is free to do so.” The court judgement against Yusuf said she had written “no to Formula One races on occupied Bahraini land” and that she had claimed F1 coming to her country was “nothing more than a way for the [ruling] al-Khalifa family to whitewash their criminal record and gross human rights violations”. She also called for a “Freedom for the Formula detainees” march to raise awareness of the protestors jailed for criticising the race, which was cancelled after demonstrations in the country in 2011. Sayed Ahmed Alwadei, the director of advocacy at Bird, said: “This is a monumental result for those who tirelessly campaigned to secure Najah’s release. Najah Yusuf is a fearless woman who bravely spoke out about the abuse she was subjected to at the hands of the Bahraini security apparatus. She should not have spent one second in prison, and must now be fully compensated for her unlawful imprisonment.” There are currently six female political prisoners in Isa Town prison. Among them is is Hajer Mansoor, who has been declared arbitrarily and unlawfully imprisoned by the UN. Najah is among 105 inmates released today."

So why does he want to want to blow the whole thing up? Brian Logan Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.54 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 16.45 BST It’s an hour after Jordan Brookes’s life changed, and we’re sitting in a cafe yards from where he just collected the 2019 Edinburgh Comedy award. He’s still buzzing, obviously. “People talk about it being a weird out-of-body experience when you hear your name announced. I genuinely couldn’t believe I’d won.” He was selected for his part-improvised show I’ve Got Nothing. Stephen Fry, a winner of the first such award in 1981, presented the trophy, which comes with a cash prize of £10,000. It’s the cash that might – in the short term – make the biggest impact. Usually, Brookes returns to London in September and looks for a full-time job. It might be in a shoe shop, behind a bar – or in the line of work that generated Sunday’s headlines (“Ex-call centre worker wins top award”) after he claimed the prize. “I don’t come from money or from any sort of privilege,” he says. “I’ve always needed a secondary income to survive.” That may change now, after joining a roll-call that includes Frank Skinner, Steve Coogan, Hannah Gadsby, and last year’s champ Rose Matafeo, who is soon to star – it was announced this month – in her own BBC sitcom. Or it may not. The award “is still hugely revered,” says Brookes, 33, “but the outcome is not as stratospheric as it used to be”. This is the first of several double-edged remarks about the ex-Perrier award made by its new champion. He “gauges [his] success”, he says, “by continuing to enjoy what I’m doing. Anything beyond that, it’s ludicrous to get caught up in.” That opinion may not be unrelated to what Brookes tells me about the origin of his comedy career – which in turn filters into the dark, destabilising work that secured him the award. After the giddyingly disruptive Body of Work (nominated in 2017) and its hi-tech follow-up Bleed, I’ve Got Nothing is Brookes’s lightest offering, an off-the-cuff(ish) set that’s been called “a standup Waiting for Godot”. The conceit is that Brookes has “got nothing”, that he’s just killing time until something happens that he can fashion into comedy. In fact, he’s prepped 35 minutes of material to weave in, about his self-hatred, the end of the world, and seducing his mum. He’s also got a startling set-piece mocking the sincere thanks with which comics often conclude their shows. Why can’t comedy encompass that weird contradiction of being happy and sad, wanting to live and wanting to die? The irony is not lost on Brookes that comedy’s most illustrious prize has gone to a show that (in his words) “doesn’t exist”. But it was one he needed to make. Partly as a reaction against Bleed – which was broadcast to its audience via binaural headphones, and “was incredibly hard work and I came out very stressed,” he says. And partly because of “how I was feeling at the time,” he adds, “which was: I don’t know what to do with my life, I don’t know where to turn, I don’t feel safe, ever. So I thought: why not explore that on stage? That sense of there being no real hope. Let’s watch a human being deal with that for an hour in a weird way.” I’ve Got Nothing, then, is a play on words – from a performer with no script, and an artist with (he felt) no clear plan, no hope, no future. In that latter sense, it’s consistent with all Brookes’s work, in which his depressive, distracted inner monologue interrupts or infects whatever is happening on stage. “I always wanted my work to reflect where people are at their darkest,” he says. “Why can’t comedy encompass that weird contradiction of being happy and sad, wanting to live and wanting to die, feeling joyful and feeling sorrowful? Why can’t it be all of those things all at once? Why can’t it be confronting us with this stuff and also distracting us from it?” Brookes’ work does just that – which is just one of the ways in which he restlessly subverts your expectations of a standup show.He doesn’t use a microphone, he dresses like a castaway (barefoot, in shorts and a button-down shirt), and he doesn’t respect the audience’s personal space. (Nor – I can report from traumatic experience – critics’ anonymity.) His sinewy body and faintly ghoulish face (onstage, he memorably brands himself a “hipster Nosferatu”) are forever behaving oddly, scrambling the signals that might let us relax into the show. “There is a lot to be explored in performer-audience dynamics,” says Brookes, “and they’re changing over time. Audiences have become a lot more restless, our attention spans have been warped by the sensory overload of the world we live in. My act is a response to all of that.” The first time I saw Brookes, that confrontational approach to convention powerfully evoked the absurdist Dutch standup Hans Teeuwen whose disturbo-charged, deeply unsettling nonsense comedy took Edinburgh by storm 11 years ago. No surprise then that Brookes cites his first Teeuwen encounter as a milestone on his own journey towards comedy. “It transformed my understanding of what you could do and get away with,” he says. Another of his influences, I confess I wouldn’t have guessed. “I know it sounds disingenuous, but I think Michael McIntyre is incredible. When I started, I said I wanted to be the existential Michael McIntyre, doing observational stuff but about disillusion, nihilism or sadness, in an accessible way that would make people really connect with those sentiments.” Brookes – originally from Merseyside – was a late adopter comedy-wise, having spent his early 20s “living at home and incredibly depressed. My mental health was really bad. I really didn’t think I was going to make it out.” He managed, first by going to University of Wales, Newport (now defunct) to study animation. He began practising standup in Cardiff, bringing his first show to Edinburgh in 2015. By the following year, he was “the comedians’ comedian”, a cult performer with a buzzy act unlike anyone else’s. But he struggled – then as now – to see himself as a big-hitter or succumb to the allure of reputation and acclaim. That’s partly, he says, because “I have very severe impostor syndrome. I very much worry that I’m no good. And no amount of external validation from an awards body is going to change that.” Why does he think that is? “I don’t know. Probably because I didn’t go to Oxbridge, so I don’t have an inbuilt sense of entitlement.” Maybe. But it’s also because Brookes is deeply ambivalent about what success might mean. Yes, he believes a wider audience could enjoy his comedy. And yes, he’s up for the new creative and commercial opportunities that being an award-winner might bring. But “do I want to be pushing myself towards arbitrary targets that I know ultimately won’t make me happy?” he asks. “I’m not motivated to be famous or to make a lot of money. It brings out the worst aspects of a person when they pursue those things. And look at the state of the world. Why would you want to be a celebrated figure as the world crumbles? I just think it’s a narcissistic thing to wish for. So I’m undone by a feeling of pointlessness as well.” If you think that sounds rich from a man who’s just won comedy’s most celebrated prize – well, Brookes tells me he considered not attending the ceremony. “In some awful way I wanted to take a stand and say, ‘I’m not going to enable that.’ Because [the award] ruins people’s mental health. It makes people very bitter, that they have to compete with one another.” When I ask if he’d happily click his fingers and make the Comedy award disappear forever, he doesn’t hesitate. “Yeah, I would happily be the last winner of the Edinburgh Comedy award.” He laughs. “I would love to be the one that pulled the pin out of the grenade.” You might also think that Brookes’s talk of “pointlessness” suggests a man still in the shadow of mental ill-health. But “I’m in a good place now and have been for a few years,” he says. “Everyone has ebbs and flows, and I know it’s a stream I can tap into for my work. But broadly I’m very happy.” Happier still, now he’s joined the ranks of the fringe comedy immortals. “It’s a lovely thing and I’m so grateful,” he concedes, adrenaline still presumably fizzing in his veins. “It’s not important, ultimately. But I know I’ll look back at this moment very fondly. And it’s a huge thing personally for me to know where I was and see where I am now. It’s ridiculous. I started somewhere very far away from where I am now.” Jordan Brookes: I’ve Got Nothing is at Soho Theatre, London, from 2-7 September, then 10-15 February 2020"

Last modified on Mon 19 Aug 2019 16.20 BST Nature is given star billing in Barrie Kosky’s staging of Eugene Onegin for Komische Oper Berlin. Designer Rebecca Ringst’s set is a swath of grass so luxuriantly verdant it drips over the edge of the stage. There is plenty of opportunity to appreciate its beauty: the meadow, like its forest backdrop, is omnipresent throughout the production. Tatyana’s bedroom letter scene, her subsequent dismissal by Onegin, her name-day ball all play out on the greenery. Even the grand St Petersburg interior of the finale is quickly, and somewhat precariously, dismantled mid-action so that Tatyana and Onegin’s final confrontation takes place back in the meadow where they first met. Artfully lit by Franck Evin, it’s undoubtedly beautiful to look at and cleverly done, but for my taste there’s something slightly monotonous about the production, which at times feels too clever for its own good. This weakens the emotional impact of the drama for all its visual appeal. Tchaikovsky, like Pushkin, might have named his opera after its antihero, but Kosky’s production makes clear that the psychodrama really belongs to its heroine. Tatyana is present on stage almost throughout, even at moments where she would not normally be involved in the action. In Edinburgh, this interpretation was strengthened by an astonishing central performance from Lithuanian soprano Asmik Grigorian. She captures the vulnerability and impetuosity of the young Tatyana, developing from initial awkwardness to throbbing, chest-beating emotionality in the letter scene. Allied with a voice that combines power and beauty, this is an utterly riveting performance, completed by her metamorphosis into self-possessed society beauty in the final act. Beside Grigorian’s luminosity, the other leads somewhat paled in comparison. As Onegin, Günter Papendell overdid the haughty ennui in the opening acts, although he was far more engaging as the impassioned lover of the final scene. Oleksiy Palchykov is a sweet-toned, although somewhat underpowered Lensky. There are fine performances in the smaller roles, particularly Dmitry Ivashchenko as a youthful, lyrical Gremin and Margarita Nekrasova’s dark-toned Filippyevna, with solid support from conductor Ainārs Rubiķis and the orchestra of Komische Oper Berlin.

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.00 BST Being broad-minded, we had an unbeliever to stay the weekend. At some point on Sunday afternoon I yelled out of the window: “You’ve got to come and see this! It’s the most astonishing game!” A languorous, world-weary voice replied from the garden: “Cricket! Always astonishing. Always historic. Always unprecedented.” She never budged. It is true that this was cricket’s second astonishing-historic-unprecedented Sunday in six weeks. It is also true it was being shown on Sky, whose policy is that everything must be treated as a-h-u even if it’s a goalless draw between Barrow and Boreham Wood. Which makes it hard to recognise an a-h-u when you see it. And on Sunday we really did (except our visitor). On such occasions, it is easy to get confused between a great game and a great finish. The World Cup final was a fairly typical 50-over contest, spiced up by the gravity of the occasion and the Stokes/Buttler‑led revival of the England innings. Planet Earth spectacularly lurched off its axis in the final moments but Headingley ’19 had more. There have been 2,358 Test matches played since 1877. In terms of closeness Headingley 2019 has a lot of competition. Two Tests have been tied, both involving Australia, against West Indies and India. Two have been drawn with the scores level and the fourth innings still in progress, the first being the “we flippin’ murdered ’em” Test in Bulawayo in 1996, named after the scorecard-defying response of England’s coach, David Lloyd, perhaps the most quoted of all his many quotable comments. There has been a one-run win (West Indies over Australia in 1993), a two- runner (Edgbaston 2005 of beloved memory) and two three‑runners, also both Ashes Tests, at Old Trafford in 1902 and Melbourne 80 years later. This time England’s win was by one wicket, which is in itself no big deal. It was the 14th in all and not even the first this year (Sri Lanka did the same to South Africa in February). Indeed, 18 Ashes Tests have been decided by one or two wickets or fewer than 20 runs. The score in these matches is 13-5 to England, and Australia’s last win was in 1925. This stat must mean something but I’m not sure what. The British ability to defy seemingly impossible odds (Betfair made them a 35-1 chance at one stage on Sunday)? England were of course 500-1 at Headingley in 1981 but that was more PR stunt than serious assessment. There is a school of thought that this long-ago win wrecked English cricket for years, making the team dependent on blind optimism rather than logic, practice and application. For God’s sake don’t pass the 13-5 figure to Downing Street. It’ll make things 10 times worse. Many superlatives have been offered these past couple of days. For Ben Stokes and his magnificent sidekick Jack Leach: Sancho Panza to his Quixote; Tonto to his Lone Ranger; Passepartout to his Phileas Fogg. Their stand passes the a-h-u exam with flying colours. Stokes took dozens of risks and got away with them brilliantly. It was indeed the stuff of fiction. But the greatest innings of all time, as some suggest? It might not be quite the same (an old fogey writes) as a few of Don Bradman’s. Assessing whether this was the greatest cricket match ever played is also tricky. Quality would be one criterion and, as we all know, England’s first-innings batting was atrocious. And Australia were without their best player. You do remember Steve Smith? But you can only play the opposition who turn up and quality is also hard to quantify. All sport is about making fewer mistakes than the opposition. Was Headingley compelling from start to finish? Almost. Australia’s second innings was a dire time but perhaps not to an Australian. And in hindsight that slow buildup of English pain was crucial to the plot – the way great detective novels accrete evidence, all pointing to the wrong suspect. Above all, because the Ashes were on the line, presumed already won and lost, the match had context. Headingley in 1981 and Edgbaston in 2005 were important battles that turned the tide at the time but both came early in the series and neither could have settled the war on their own, whoever won. The most enjoyable Test I watched involved Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart defying the West Indies quicks and conjuring a three-wicket victory in Trinidad in 1998. But that was a very personal memory and meant little in the great scheme of things. Athers was gone as captain five weeks later, something that may yet happen to Joe Root in three. The most compelling I remember was the Centenary Test at Melbourne in March 1977. The Ashes were not at stake – it was a one-off – and it was invisible from Britain but the memory of listening from my dingy flat to Derek Randall’s epic 174 is with me for ever. Hardly anyone knew the camaraderie of that occasion was greased by the fact most of the players were plotting to desert Test cricket and join the breakaway led by the tycoon Kerry Packer. The original tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, had an impact that surged across the cricketing world. Hardly anyone saw it at the time – even Australia’s No 1 commentator, Alan McGilvray, was so certain of defeat he took an early plane home. But it set up a terrific series: the excitement, after much dourness in the 1950s, the class of the players and the amity between the teams helped rekindle enthusiasm for the game. With that match a close second, I think – for its twists, turns and thrills and its collective and individual sense of redemption – Headingley ’19 may be the best of them all. Note to readers: The above column contains no criticism of the ECB, ICC, MCC or any other component of the alphabet soup that runs cricket. Normal service will be resumed shortly."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 08.26 BST The first time I ever put a ​5¼-inch disk into an Apple II drive to play Lode Runner, I was hooked. It seemed wildly futuristic – this was in the early 1980s – but there was also something pleasingly analogue about the process. You had to slide the disc from its sleeve like a vinyl record, then gently feed it into the mouth of the drive, before closing the little plastic door behind it with a satisfying click. The loading noise was a stuttering series of electronic snare drum taps, accompanied by the baseline hum of the computer itself. There was something almost organic about it, like a CT scan or ultrasound. To me it seemed incredible that typing something on a screen could cause the disk to start loading, as though I was talking to the computer, and the clicking noise only accentuated this feeling of communication. In these early days of video game playing, the actual game was only part of the experience – the allure began with the novelty of the loading process. The retrofuturistic noise of a disk drive still makes me wistful whenever I hear it on old movies and TV shows, or highly specialist YouTube videos such as this one: Veteran video game players may also remember, often with similarly warm nostalgia, the experience of loading a game on to a ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64. They came on cassette tapes, so you had that chunky, rattling sound as you grabbed the tape from its plastic case. Then there were all the noises we associate with tape players: the clunk of the eject button, sliding the tape in, pushing the lid back down. This sequence of actions, also familiar from playing music tapes, was hugely fetishised by teen movies of the era. If someone was going to play music in a 1980s movie, we’d always get a closeup shot of the tape going in, the lid being closed and the play button being pressed. It meant something cool was coming. It was the same with video games. And pressing play was just the beginning. When a game started loading on a Speccy or C64, the speakers would begin to emit a series of high-pitched screeching noises, like incredibly challenging electronic music – the literal sound of data, of ones and noughts, being rendered as audio. Experienced players got to know and understand the unique noises each of their games made, and could tell when they were about to finish loading from the tones being played. The sound was also freighted with tension because, if it stopped, it generally meant the process had crashed and you’d have to start loading again – which could mean another five minutes of waiting. When you had friends over, all hoping to be the first to get a go on Way of the Exploding Fist, the tension was multiplied. You’d all sit around the tape player like safe crackers, listening intently, hoping for the right clicks. The veteran games programmer Fred Williams, who wrote several classic titles for Codemasters, reminded me about ‘The Chuntey’, the name given by Spectrum fans to the invisible field surrounding the machine’s cassette player into which only positive vibes could be admitted or else the process would break down. Loading was a religious ceremony and the sounds were sacrosanct. With consoles such as the NES and Mega Drive, the sounds were different again. Your games were on cartridges that came in big plastic boxes that opened with a satisfying thunk. You’d have to lever them out of their holders and then jam your cartridge into the console port, hearing the ping of the cart’s copper contacts easing into the input array. Carts were so hefty and present, like VHS tapes, and they often worryingly rattled a little bit too, which again gave gamers a clue about how long they were likely to last or why they weren’t loading. Nowadays, all we hear is the soft whine as a DVD or Blu-Ray drive spins into motion. It’s still a nice sound, but there is little variety and it doesn’t give you as much feedback about the loading process. We can’t speak or understand the language of loading any more. And many of us download games digitally anyway, so there is no sound at all. I really miss the early whirs, clicks and plasticky clunks of old video game systems. There was something so comforting about them. I remember reading an interview with Ridley Scott in which he talked about how the sounds of the life support systems coming online at the beginning of Alien were meant to resemble the noises babies hear in the womb. There is definitely something of that in old floppy disk drives, analogue monitors and processor fans. But for me, it’s the grinding electronic dirge of the 8-bit computer loading screens that brings the most nostalgia. A few indie musicians at the time put samples of these noises into their songs, and I know why: they’re weird and distorted and nonsensical, but they’re also instantly resonant. They’re the sounds of excitement, just around the corner."

Kruijswijk was among several Jumbo-Visma riders involved in a crash in the team time trial on the opening stage of the Vuelta which seriously harmed the team’s chances of challenging for the general classification. The Dutchman was able to complete stages two and three but Jumbo-Visma announced in a brief statement on Twitter during Tuesday’s stage that he had withdrawn due to a sore knee, with the pain worsening since Saturday’s crash. Kruijswijk was Jumbo-Visma’s co-leader at the Vuelta alongside the highly fancied Primoz Roglic, and his withdrawal is a blow for the Slovenian’s chances of an overall victory as the Dutchman is strong in mountain stages, where he would have been able to support his team mate.

Black men can’t swim,” says Linford Christie. What nonsense. The 59-year-old Olympic gold medallist and former world champion is now spending 12 weeks proving himself and the stereotype wrong. Along with 10 other celebrities who, like 25% of British adults, struggle to swim, Christie is getting in condition to form a relay team that next month will swim 21 miles across the Channel. Which, as you know, is an obstacle course featuring jellyfish, waves, cold, polluted water, plastic debris, container ships, gulls ready to feast on your still-warm corpse, and the piercing shards of shattered human dreams. More people have climbed Everest than have swum the Channel, says Keri-Anne Payne, the two-time 10km open-water world champion and coach to this – no offence – unpromising bunch. In his pomp, Christie clocked 9.87 seconds over 100m. He is a little slower over 500m. To be fair, those 500m are in Windermere, and Christie isn’t the only one out of his element. Yes, it takes him an hour to swim to shore and, yes, the former Towie cast member Arg, who is morbidly obese (he put on 64kg, or 10st, in two years and is 50% fat), took only 21 minutes to complete the same course. But so what? Earlier this summer, Christie couldn’t swim at all. As for Arg, how clever of him to name himself after what he will be shouting at rescue boats next month. Plenty of other stereotypes are overturned in the opening episode of Sink Or Swim (Channel 4). Sair Khan, a star of Coronation Street and a reality show recidivist (she was on I’m a Celebrity), says people from her background don’t really swim, since the focus is putting food on the table. She probably means Muslims, not people from Weatherfield. But recall the relevant hadith: “Teach your children swimming, archery and horse riding.” Happily, Khan clocks 21 minutes over 500m, making her the fastest of the women taking part. The Last Leg presenter Alex Brooker was born with hand and arm deformities and a twisted right leg that had to be amputated when he was a baby. How does he feel in 17C water? “I’ve only got one set of toes I can’t feel.” Upbeat guy. I love his mum’s back-garden pep talk: “You were a boy, now you’re a man,” she says, while he eyes her sceptically. “Have you gone on the internet for inspirational quotes from mum to son? You’ve never said anything like that before.” I shouldn’t enjoy this show, for all that it raises money for Stand Up to Cancer. It contravenes Larry David’s rule when writing Seinfeld: no hugs, no learning. Sink Or Swim is all hugs and learning, reality TV at its most algorithmically constructed. Go-to-ad-break jeopardy? Check. Manipulative mood music when the celebrity sets out their sad backstory? Check. Christie joking about the flotation powers of his legendary lunchbox? Afraid so. But when Brooker fights off tears and pain to complete his 500m swim and collapse into Greg Rutherford’s arms, I well up like a Cumbrian rain cloud. That said, Sink Or Swim leaves questions to be answered. What happens if someone drops the baton mid-Channel? Are you allowed to swim after it and, if so, for how long before you are disqualified? After all, this is a bumbling British relay team we are talking about. The biggest question of all concerns another Towie star, Georgia Kousoulou. Payne tells her there isn’t enough time left for her to get into shape to battle the cruel sea, so Kousoulou leaves the show – even though, ironically, she is a swimwear designer. “When you really think about it,” she had said earlier, “why would I want to swim?” Quite right. Why would anyone? But doesn’t this development mean 10 will have to do the swimming of 11? If it is not too late, they should bring in a ringer, ideally the heroic teacher Sadie Davies, who just swam 15 miles from the Hartland Point in north Devon to Lundy, to raise money for the environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage. But that probably wouldn’t be fair. Next up, White Men Can Jump, in which celebrities including Stephen Fry, David Cameron, Rick Wakeman, Tony Blair, Danny Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg raise money for charity by going to basketball camp. Twelve weeks later, they emerge with the right stuff to beat a team including LeBron James, Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan. Don’t pretend you wouldn’t watch it."

Last modified on Mon 12 Aug 2019 09.45 BST Jamie Chadwick is, at 21, quick, compelling to watch and no stranger to winning. She already boasts an impressive racing CV and on Sunday afternoon is in every position to add to it by becoming the inaugural winner of the all‑women W Series championship in the final round at Brands Hatch. For Chadwick, though, this is just a step towards her ultimate goal. “F1 is the dream of every young driver,” she says. Earlier this year Chadwick was taken on by the Williams F1 team as part of their junior driver programme, which she says is the first proper step in fulfilling her ambition. “Being in amongst the team, you learn how they operate, how an F1 team works … It hits home to me that, if I do a good job and get to be where I need to be and there is an opportunity down the line, it makes that dream feel a lot more like reality.” The W Series was created to promote women in motor sport. It does not require them to have any financial backing and the series meets all their costs. Its aim is to showcase and develop talent and ultimately, the organisers hope, to help enable a woman to race in F1. Chadwick is more than aware of some of the harsh realities of racing. “Motor sport is filled with false hope,” she says. “You might get a phone call from an F1 team. I had one and quite often they have massive price tags on them. The reason they want you involved is because they want the big cheque.” In contrast the Williams deputy team principal, Claire Williams, went to the first W Series race at Hockenheim to see Chadwick first hand, before discussing a programme at the team with her, without requiring backing. Chadwick duly impressed. She put her car on pole superbly in treacherous wet conditions in Germany and went on to win, taking a lead in the six‑meeting championship she has not relinquished. She has two wins and three other podium finishes and enters the finale 13 points ahead of Beitske Visser of the Netherlands. Visser has to finish in the top three to have any chance of catching her and whatever she does will not be enough if the British driver finishes on the podium again. Chadwick, from Bath, already holds some impressive records, despite not starting racing until she was 13, late by modern standards. In 2015 she became the first woman – and youngest driver – to win the British GT championship. In doing so she won the Britcar 24 Hours at Silverstone, becoming at 17 the youngest winner of a 24-hour race. She then entered single-seaters with two seasons in British F3 and last year at Brands Hatch was the first woman to win a British F3 race. This year she became the first woman to win the MRF Challenge Formula 2000 championship. The W Series, however, was an entirely new proposition. The 20 drivers, all racing the same, single‑seater F3 cars, swap vehicles and engineers at every race and share all their data. They all speak of the friendly, collegiate atmosphere and sense of purpose it brings. “It’s bizarre, like being back at boarding school,” says Chadwick. “It’s like nothing else I have experienced and a pleasant surprise. “Racing drivers are often isolated. You go about your junior career as an individual. You are never amongst other drivers 24-7. Here you are all together, you race each other, then you go to the hotel and have dinner together. When you have 20 like-minded female drivers, naturally you are going to get on. It is intense in a positive way, socially intense, mentally intense.” Chadwick has collected acclaim throughout her career. She drove for Aston Martin in British GT and their three-times Le Mans-winning works driver Darren Turner described her as having “a natural, smooth driving style and a good understanding of what makes a car work and how to make it go fast”. Williams recognised similar strengths. “Jamie was the obvious candidate,” she says. “She is doing a great job in W Series, great attitude, approach and drive. She is part of the academy, so we can support her path into the higher echelons of motor sport whatever that will be. It’s early days, she has a good pedigree behind her but she has a lot of work to do. F1 is a long way off. She has to put the work in to get there. I think she has some great talent.” The champion will take away $500,000 yet beyond the money and glory of taking the title there is a genuine sense that the W Series has already made a difference. Chadwick, who was initially sceptical of the concept, believes the selection process showed the right intent. Fifty-five drivers were evaluated at the Melk circuit in Austria, where they were tested not in F3 machinery but road cars. “They didn’t do it in an F3 car because that would be an advantage to those that had driven in F3,” she says. “They made it clear they were just trying to find natural talent. That stood out for me. They were just going for the right people.” Those selected included older drivers such as Britain’s Alice Powell, whose career had all but ended due to a lack of funding and who has described racing as “a billionaire boys’ club”. She proved she should be in a car, standing fourth in the championship. Others have prospered, too. “Fabienne Wohlwend is going full-time next season thanks to the attention she has received,” Chadwick says. “Marta García had already written off her career at 17 and she’s had a second chance. We are looking at a lot of girls that are coming into it after a few years out but hopefully also now, as it goes on, we will see more girls aspire to get into the sport because of this.” Formula One has not had a female driver in a championship race since Lella Lombardi at the Austrian Grand Prix in 1976. It seems hard to imagine that when one finally returns she will not have at some point been on the W Series grid. This may still be some way off but in the meantime Chadwick intends to keep her foot on the gas. “I just want to keep pushing as hard as I can,” she says. “At the moment, with support from Williams and W Series, I am in a good position. At Brands Hatch it would be nice to properly seal it off with a win.”"

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/26/lord-bell-obituary,"Public relations executive who worked as a close adviser to Margaret Thatcher and claimed that he came up with the ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ slogan Stephen Bates Mon 26 Aug 2019 13.13 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 21.16 BST Tim Bell, Lord Bell, the advertising and public relations executive, who has died aged 77, was the man who claimed to have come up with the slogan “Labour Isn’t Working” that helped Margaret Thatcher win the 1979 general election. He went on to be one of her closest advisers for the rest of her life, and announced her death in April 2013. “I loved her,” he admitted in his ghostwritten memoirs Right or Wrong, published the following year. “I am a hero-worshipper. I work for my demi-gods.” In her memoirs, Thatcher claimed that Bell had better political antennae than most politicians: “He could pick up quicker than anyone else a change in the national mood. And, unlike most advertising men, he understood that selling ideas is different from selling soap.” Bell it was who, along with Gordon Reece, advised Thatcher on interview technique, what clothes to wear and even her hairstyle, and spent Christmases at Chequers when she was prime minister. “She changed my life completely. She used to think I was in touch with ordinary folk. God knows why.” Indeed. For while Bell was the sort of man who appealed to her as a courtier, smooth, blunt and with the looks of a 1950s British cinema leading man, he really had little congruence with ordinary people, despite having been born in suburban north London and educated at a state grammar school. Hard drinking, heavy on the expenses, an 80-a-day smoker, living in Belgravia, his was a life of backstage whispers and casual amorality in business. “The only talent I have is charm,” he admitted to Campaign magazine in 2014. His career ended in ignominy when Bell Pottinger, the company he had founded and run for 28 years, was closed down in 2017, having been found to have breached ethical principles after an independent inquiry into its business dealings in South Africa. Bell was born in Southgate, the son of Arthur Bell, a salesman from Belfast, who abandoned his Australian-born wife Greta (nee Findlay) and emigrated to South Africa when his son was five. She subsequently married Peter Pettit, a solicitor, who became the Conservative mayor of Marylebone in 1961. Bell was educated at Queen Elizabeth grammar school, Barnet, but left at 17 to become a messenger in the postroom at ABC Television. He had apparently thought of becoming a teacher, but subsequently claimed in the Daily Telegraph in 2015 that he had decided against the profession because of its “lazy, whingeing, Guardian-obsessed staff rooms”. Instead, he worked his way through a series of jobs in advertising agencies before joining the brothers Charles and Maurice Saatchi, who in 1970 were starting their own advertising agency. It was a hard-driving upstart in the industry, hustling for business with a contempt for the larger, longer-established companies. Bell fitted right in. Known to some, though not to Maurice or Charles, as the third brother, he became unofficial managing director, building contacts with national newspaper editors and smoothing over internal rows. In 1979, when the Saatchis won the Tory account for the forthcoming election, it was Bell who was deputed to liaise with Thatcher. Although James Callaghan’s Labour government was faltering anyway, the agency’s aggressive campaign probably helped to tip the balance, especially with the poster campaign showing a long line of unemployed claimants – really Conservative party volunteers recruited for the occasion. Bell claimed credit for the campaign, though others at Saatchi and Saatchi devised the poster. Thatcher apparently had to be convinced that the slogan Labour Isn’t Working would be effective since it named the Tories’ opponents in larger type than theirs. One of Bell’s tasks, then and subsequently, was to steer her away from some of her more naive suggestions. He remained as an unofficial adviser throughout Thatcher’s term in office, calling in for late-night drinks. In 1984 he was seconded to the National Coal Board to advise on presentation during the miners’ strike, though he had only limited success with its brusque and awkward Scottish-American chairman Sir Ian MacGregor. A motto that appealed to Bell was: “Why tell the truth when a lie will do?” He said in his memoirs: “I am a moral man (but) there were many times when I would adopt the same philosophy.” He added that he “retrofitted” facts: “We could in those days find statistics that proved anything … you could argue we were always trying to stretch the truth, but then everybody was at the time.” When a subsequent Tory chairman, Chris Patten, queried the veracity of a claim, Bell’s retort was: “We’re not saying it’s true, we are saying it could be true.” Bell left the Saatchis in 1985 to co-found his own public relations agency, Lowe Howard-Spink and Bell, which became Bell Pottinger three years later and was subsumed in 1994 into Chime Communications, of which he became chairman. Bell Pottinger became well-known for its willingness to represent rightwing figures and regimes, using the excuse that everyone deserved representation. Among its clients were the Pinochet regime, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, Asma al-Assad, wife of the Syrian dictator, the Sultan of Brunei and the Sri Lankan government during its war with the Tamils. Domestically it represented the Tory minister David Mellor during his extramarital affair, the businessman Ernest Saunders, convicted of manipulating Guinness shares during a takeover battle, Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, Rebekah Wade, the Murdoch executive during the phone hacking scandal, and Neil Hamilton in his battle with the Guardian over the cash for questions scandal. The agency lobbied on behalf of the Saudi Arabian government during the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation into bribery allegations over the Al Yamamah arms deal, an inquiry that was subsequently dropped. “Contrary to the illusion people have, I would not represent Saddam Hussein or Hitler,” Bell told the Telegraph in 2015, adding that he would never represent the Labour party either. “I have represented people who are thought to be evil, but I only represent them because they promised me they were going to stop being evil and when they carried on being evil, I walked away.” The agency declined to represent Robert Mugabe over a financial transaction, but only because he did not take their advice. In 2012, Bell and his associate James Henderson bought out Chime’s controlling interest, though the company retained a 25% share. However, the pair soon fell out over strategy and Bell left in August 2016. Within a year Bell Pottinger became embroiled in a crisis involving its South African subsidiary which was shown to have run a campaign for the Indian Gupta brothers, who had controversial business ties to the country’s government. The campaign, with its racist attack on “white monopoly capital” opponents, outraged other agency clients including the businessman Johann Rupert, who complained. The crisis deepened when Bell was shown to have sat in on the discussions about taking on the business, sending an enthusiastic email back to London predicting a lucrative deal. As clients deserted Bell Pottinger across the world, Bell’s excuse that he had actually opposed the deal rang hollow, particularly when he appeared on Newsnight to defend himself against the constant sound of his mobile phone going off – an elementary gaffe for a supposed PR guru. The company folded within days. Bell suffered from ill health, the result of his chain smoking for many years, including cancer and diabetes. He had a triple heart bypass operation in 2001. He was knighted by Thatcher in 1991 after she left office and was ennobled by Tony Blair in 1998, despite his antipathy to the Labour leader. “I have led a charmed life,” he told the Mail on Sunday in 2017. “I want to be the sort of person who walks into a restaurant and people say, isn’t that so-and-so? It’s insecurity, not vanity.” Bell was married three times, once briefly in his 20s, then subsequently in 1988 to Virginia Hornbrook, with whom he had two children, Daisy and Harry. That marriage was dissolved in 2016 and the following year he married Jacky Phillips. • Timothy John Leigh Bell, Lord Bell, public relations consultant and media strategy adviser, born 18 October 1941; died 25 August 2019"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.20 BST There are things you can learn about yourself only in extremis: when your plane ditches in the Arctic tundra, for instance. Instead of the untapped action hero you’ve always suspected lives inside you, you discover you’re actually the scene-one extra who would rather succumb to a rapid and surprisingly comfortable hypothermia. At least you’re leaving the real fighters something to eat. For those of us too young to have experienced Headingley ’81 – or, as it shall be known from now on, the other Headingley – this weekend’s game was our great examination. Our Test of character, if you will. What kind of fans were we? Were we Ripley in Alien, running out of crew members yet still fighting our way through the darkness in the face of a deadly fear? Or the lawyer in Jurassic Park, cowering in a toilet cubicle until we inevitably got eaten? Plenty of England fans woke up on Monday morning to the warm embrace of post-adrenal joy, only to find it instantly contaminated by the remembrance of tweets past. Had they really told @root66 that he should do the decent thing and abdicate in favour of Eoin Morgan? It was even worse for Aussies. At least in ’81 no one could keep a screenshot of your text, crowing across 10 time zones, that England had all the spine of a gelatinous zooplankton. I suspect that in this age of information – when the wealthy can have their entire genome mapped and the rest of us can find out we’re a little bit Scandinavian and should probably eat less mashed potato – that everything cricket fans need to know about themselves can be revealed through a statistical breakdown of what parts of the game they consumed live. Given the right questionnaire, the guys at CricViz could construct you a profile far more revealing than your Myers-Briggs results. England fans, at which first-innings wicket did you switch off your TV/mute your radio/rip the broadband cable from the wall in anger and throw the router out of the window? One point for each you stuck around for. Australians, answer truthfully – on what day did you stop bothering to stay up for the evening session? Score zero if you went to bed before the start of play on Sunday. Once England were two down, there were plenty of home fans who just wanted the thing over quickly Most fans – those with game awareness, a knowledge of cricketing history, and any grasp on reality – were mentally FedExing the Ashes back to Australia by day three. (Let’s be honest, plenty of us had filled out the shipping form at 138 for six on the first day of actual play at Lord’s.) But it was the run chase – some of us are still boggling at that term, which always felt entirely inappropriate for the situation – that separated the men from the boys, the girls from the women, and the grumpy-wumpy misery‑guts from the never-say-die diehards. Once England were two down, there were plenty of home fans who just wanted the thing over quickly. Finish it off, Pat Cummins. Put us out of our misery, Nathan Lyon. Don’t leave us lying here, two shots to the gut, to bleed out a slow, painful and undignified end. It was a sign of respect to turn off the telly then, to draw a veil over whatever innings Joe Denly was scratching out, to give Joe Root his privacy. I can’t be the only person who spent Saturday afternoon watching nothing more than guilty snatches of England’s batting, firing the screen up for a hit of score (wait, is that really still a 2 after the hyphen?). Watching a single delivery I was sure would splatter the stumps, before I lurched at the standby button to make sure the charm wasn’t broken. By the next morning, the spell had worn off. I’d woken up to the sober thought of a fresh pace attack and an imminent new ball and a psychological crack in England’s middle order so deep you could abseil Carl Jung down it. At this stage, we sceptics, cynics, and out-and-out pessimists knew: it was the righteous and responsible thing to puncture not only our own unhealthy fantasies but everyone else’s, too. We’d lived through the 90s. We’d seen our share of impossible fourth-innings totals. Hence the regrettable tweets. Of course we’d forgotten one thing: this is a summer of miracles. We lived through one just six weeks ago and yet, like the Israelites fresh out of Egypt, had forgotten it already. We had doubted. We did not deserve to see Ben Stokes come into his full glory. This is all by way of explanation for what happened to me on Sunday afternoon. I can only assume it was divine intervention that delayed my flight to Edinburgh just long enough that the last thing I saw was Chris Woakes getting out. By the time I landed an hour later, England were only 18 runs away, and I had missed most of the firework finale of one of the greatest Test innings the world will ever see. Still, England won, and I don’t regret a thing. • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/23/erica-review,"PlayStation 4; Flavourworks/SonyThis experiment in storytelling has a fascinating premise – but its repetitiveness renders it a lesser Bandersnatch Stuart Heritage Fri 23 Aug 2019 08.00 BST


Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 08.44 BST Had Erica been released a year ago, chances are it would have made quite a splash. An interactive, full-motion video thriller where you control the decisions of troubled youngster it is as a brave, bold experiment in storytelling. But then Bandersnatch came along, and then Telling Lies. Now Erica feels like old news. The game itself isn’t necessarily to blame. Without similar competition, Erica would have still found a small, passionate clutch of fans eager to discover non-traditional gaming experiences. But Telling Lies is more complete as an interactive adventure, and Bandersnatch is bigger and more mainstream. Plus – as much as I hate to admit it – it was better. Bandersnatch branched off with just enough regularity to keep its users on their toes; scenes would often play out uninterrupted, but you never lost the feeling that you were in control. Erica, meanwhile, refuses to give it a rest. The story – a young girl confronts her violent past in a supernatural dance of the occult – has the potential to be truly fascinating. But it’s stymied at every turn by endless back-breaking chores. The game opens with you flicking open a lighter by swiping at the motion pad of your controller. Then you have to light it with another swipe. And then you have to light a lamp, then put a stylus on a record player, all with swipes. When you encounter a door, you have to turn the knob. When you find curtains, you have to pull them back. Misted windows have to be thoroughly wiped clear before you can see what’s behind them. Boxes have to be laboriously opened latch by latch. None of these actions have any real effect on the story but you’re forced to perform them anyway, over and over, until your bones creak. In one early scene, I found myself confronted with a chest of drawers; the thought of having to swipe to open, inspect and close each drawer in turn made me audibly groan. The mark of success for interactive narratives is how often you want to replay them. With Bandersnatch, the end of one story was simply an excuse to jump back in and explore other options. But it’s different with Erica where the amount of busywork means you’re rushing to the end to be done with it. There’s plenty of intrigue here, and in better circumstances you’d want to spend more time with the characters in order to understand their perspectives. But by the fifth time you’ve opened a lock that could have so easily have opened automatically, all you really want to do is find the quickest possible route to the exit. It’s a shame, because the other elements of Erica are pleasingly robust. Holly Earl – who you might recognise as Agnes in Humans – plays Erica: it’s a thankless task, since her role amounts to adopting the expression of a worried deer and repeating dialogue picked by the player. But she manages to achieve a baseline of charisma that other performers would struggle with. The same goes for the peripheral characters, who all have to maintain a low-level ambiguity in their delivery, on the off-chance that the player will make choices that radically alter their personality. This could be frustratingly vague, but it’s sold with real menace. There’s a good game at the heart of Erica. But it’d be so much better if the interactive elements were reduced considerably. For an interactive story, that doesn’t bode well."

00:45 That’s all for our day session coverage. Thanks as always for following along and be sure to check back for full reports off tonight’s night session matches. 12.42am BST
00:42 No 9 seed Karen Khachanov is out of the US Open after a shock 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 loss to Vasek Pospisil! The 23-year-old Russian becomes the fourth top-10 seed to crash out of the men’s draw today after No 4 Dominic Thiem, No 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas and No 10 Roberto Bautista Agut. Madness. 12.42am BST
00:42 Coco Gauff is through to the US Open second round after rallying for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Anastasia Potapova. A wildly entertaining match between a pair of wildly talented teenagers ends with Gauff breaking her opponent. She tips her cap to the home support during an on-court interview with ESPN’s Pam Shriver: “Honestly, it’s because of the crowd. You guys were amazing. No matter where I was on the court, I could always hear somebody supporting me and I really am grateful for that.” 12.32am BST
00:32 Pospisil has broken the ninth-seeded Khachanov for 4-2 in the fifth and moves within two holds of yet another high-profile men’s upset. Over on Armstrong the pressure only builds as Gauff is showing signs of tightness at 4-all in the third against the game Potapova. 12.27am BST
00:27 Gauff, serving at 4-2, falls behind 15-40 to give Potapova a pair of break-point chances in their pressure-packed showcase on Armstrong. But the American follows with her third double fault of the day to gift her opponent the break and we’re on serve in the third. Also on serve in a deciding set: No 9 seed Karen Khachanov is serving at 2-3 in a touch-and-go battle with Canada’s Vasel Pospisil. Elsewhere, another Canadian upset bid is fastly unfolding as unseeded Denis Shapovalov has taken a 6-1, 6-1 lead over a listless Felix Auger-Allassime, the No 18 seed. 12.21am BST
00:21 Coco Gauff is ahead 4-1 in the third set as Potapova takes a medical timeout for her right shoulder. The young American is in fine shape here with the second round within touching distance. Meanwhile, Frances Tiafoe is through to round two after Ivo Karlovic, who dropped the first two sets, retires early in the third. 12.07am BST
00:07 The all-Canadian battle between Denis Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime is under way and it’s been one-way traffic so far. The unseeded Shapovalov raced to a pair of breaks to win 6-1 in the opener. Should it continue this way and Auger-Aliassime go out, it would leave No 13 Gael Monfils, No 24 Mateo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios as the only seeds in that entire quarter of the men’s draw. 12.00am BST
00:00 Tennys Sandgren has completed a gripping comeback from two sets down to win 1-6, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 7-6 (5), 7-5 over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The 2018 Australian Open quarter-finalist survived a tense fourth-set tiebreak on Court 5 before earning his second break of the match in the fifth and landing the plane. He advances to face the winner of the Karen Khachanov-Vasek Pospisil match that’s just headed to a fifth set on Court 12. 11.55pm BST
23:55 Well, well, well. Coco Gauff bounces back from an underwhelming opening set to run away with the second by a 6-2 score and we’re headed to a decider on Armstrong. The American teenager is putting a bit more air under her shots to change the pace of the rallies and showing more variety in her shotmaking, mixing in drop shots and net approaches with great effect. They both went off court ahead of the third set for bathroom breaks and will resume shortly. 11.41pm BST
23:41 Dominic Thiem attributed his four-set loss Thomas Fabbiano to the illness that’s sapped his strength for most of the month. Said the 25-year-old Austrian during an abbreviated press conference beneath Arthur Ashe Stadium: “What happened is what I said before the tournament: that I’ll play, I’ll be able to play the match, but I don’t know what’s going to happen. I got very, very tired and exhausted after two sets. I’m far away from 100%. Like this, it’s very tough to win. I went on court because in tennis, especially in such long two-week tournaments, anything can happen. But it is what it is.” He added: “I’m honest with you that, I mean, congratulations to [Fabbiano] and I’m happy for him. But it was not the real me there on the court. All I was thinking about was me, how I somehow can win the match. But I don’t know how much his performance is worth because was not against the real me. That’s why.” 11.35pm BST
23:35 Gauff is back on course in the second set after immediately breaking back for 1-all, then consolidating with a drama-free hold. Meanwhile, yet another big name is in trouble as No 9 seed Karen Khachanov finds himself down two sets to one against 216th-ranked Vasek Pospisil of Canada out on Court 12. Could the 23-year-old Russian become the fourth top-10 seed to crash out today after No 4 Dominic Thiem, No 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas and No 10 Roberto Bautista Agut? 11.15pm BST
23:15 Coco Gauff’s first major since her Wimbledon breakthrough is off to a rocky start. Her opponent, Russia’s Anastasia Potapova, capitalized on both her break-point chances in the early going to race to a 5-1 lead in the opening set before a rollicking crowd on Armstrong, but the 15-year-old American has just pulled one of them back with a backhand winner on break point before holding at love with new balls for 3-5. Potapova will now have a second chance to serve for the first set. Elsewhere, the American Tennys Sandgren has scratched back from two sets down to force a decider against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Court 5. 10.56pm BST
22:56 We weren’t lying when we said it was getting a wee bit wild in the quarter formerly known as Thiem’s. The No 4, No 8, No 10 and No 30 seeds have all gone out in the last few hours, leaving only No 13 Gael Monfils, No 18 Felix Auger-Aliassime, No 24 Mateo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios still standing and all but guaranteeing a semi-finalist that could be safely be qualified as a surprise. One of these 22 guys will be a #USOpen semi-finalist this year. pic.twitter.com/MomnJ0aTnX 10.41pm BST
22:41 The emerging American star Coco Gauff has taken the court for her first-rounder against Russian teenager Anastasia Potapova. This is a bit of a tricker match for Gauff than it might appear on paper: The 18-year-old is a former junior No 1 and won the Wimbledon girls’ title in 2016. Here’s our Tumaini Carayol’s lookahead to the match. 10.36pm BST
22:36 Thomas Fabbiano strikes again, dumping fourth-seeded Dominic Thiem from the US Open in a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 upset! It’s the second high-profile scalp for the giant-killing Italian in as many major tournaments after his first-round win over Stefanos Tsitsipas at Wimbledon. That leaves No 2 Rafael Nadal and No 6 Alexander Zverev – whom it appears will survive an upset scare against Moldova’s Radu Albot on Court 17 – as the only top-10 seeds remaining in this half of the draw. 10.30pm BST
22:30 Kyle Edmund is out of the US Open after a gutting 3-6, 7-6 (1), 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 defeat to Spain’s Pablo Andújar. The British No 1 dropped the final six games on the trot, but can take some minor consolation in knowing his ranking won’t take a hit given his first-round ouster at Flushing Meadows last year. Meanwhile, Thiem is on the brink of elimination on Ashe with Fabbiano serving for the match at 5-2 in the fourth ... Updated

22:23 It’s all come undone for Edmund! Moments after Andújar consolidates his break for 4-2, the No 30 seed is broken at love with a series of misfires off the backhand side. Andújar will serve for the match at 5-2 after the changeover. 10.20pm BST
22:20 Andújar has nosed ahead in the fifth set against Edmund, breaking for a 3-2 lead on Court 13. The British No 1 managed to save four break points in marathon 18-point game, but Andújar finally came through on his fifth chance with a backhand winner from the baseline. On Armstrong, Simona Halep is through to the second round after ending her two-match losing streak at the US Open with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 win over the feisty Nicole Gibbs. Updated
at 11.21pm BST 10.04pm BST
22:04 Deciders abound! As Edmund and Andújar are locked at 2-all in the fifth set, Radu Albot has just forced a fifth from two sets down against the sixth-seeded Alexander Zverev on Court 17. Meanwhile, Halep has scored an early break against Gibbs in the third set on Armstrong. Excitement all around the grounds on a breezy 23C (73F) afternoon in Queens. 9.51pm BST
21:51 Halep and Gibbs are heading to a decider after a gripping end to the second set. With the Wimbledon champion trailing 2-5 after taking the opener from the American lucky loser, Halep saves no less than six set points to break her opponent’s serve ... but Gibbs immediately breaks back and we’re headed to a third set on Armstrong. Meanwhile on Ashe, Dominic Thiem is in serious trouble after falling behind 2-5 in the third set against Italy’s Thomas Fabbiano having already dropped the first. 9.40pm BST
21:40 What a turn for Edmund! He’s just broken Andújar at love, capping the game with a backhand winner down the line punctuated by a fist pump, that’s leveled the score at 6-3, 6-7 (1), 5-7, 7-5 after three hours and 34 minutes. We’re heading to a decider on Court 13. 9.36pm BST
21:36 Kyle Edmund is in a quite a fight on Court 13 against Spain’s Pablo Andújar. The No 30 seed and British No 1, who dropped the second and third sets after taking the opener, has just held for 6-5 in the fourth. The Spaniard will now serve to force a tie-breaker. Updated
at 9.36pm BST 9.29pm BST
21:29 Gibbs has broken early in the second set against the fourth-seeded Halep, a promising turn after losing three straight games to drop the opener. The American hit a lovely forehand volley winner on break point to cap an 11-shot rally, bringing the partisan Armstrong crowd to life. Elsewhere, Gilles has taken out American wild card Bjorn Frantangelo by a 5-7, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5 scoreline, a match that included a whopping 48 break points over four hours and 19 minutes. Updated

21:12 Stefanos Tsitsipas addressed his on-court spat with chair umpire Damien Dumusois during today’s first-round loss to Andrey Rublev. The 21-year-old Greek, who battled cramps during the business end of the nearly four-hour match, was vocally perturbed after receiving a point penalty for a second time violation. Q. As you had the argument with the chair umpire, could you take us through what made you so upset? You were heard saying, ‘You’re all weirdos.’ Who were you talking about? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: The chair umpire was very incorrect in what he was telling me during the match. I don’t know what this chair umpire has in specific against my team but he’s been complaining and telling me that my team talks all of the time when I’m out on the court playing. He’s very – I don’t know. I believe he’s not right, because I never hear anything of what my team says from the outside. And there is nothing that I personally believe can help my game or make me play better. My father outside, who usually does the talking, he’s trying to pump me up by saying, you know, Come on. Raising my confidence by not coaching but by trying to boost me up. I believe the coach for my opponent does the same thing, which is normal. This chair umpire, I don’t know, he has something against me. I don’t know why. Q. So you’re saying the chair umpires were weirdos? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I wish that all the chair umpires were like Mohamed Lahyani because I believe he’s the best out in the game, and we need more like him in tennis because he’s fair to everyone. I feel like some of them have preferences when they are on the court. 9.02pm BST
21:02 Upset alert on Ashe as fourth-seeded Dominic Thiem has dropped the first set to Italy’s Thomas Fabbiano. The world No 87 is no stranger to early-round upsets, having taken out Tsitsipas at the All England Club this summer. Meanwhile on Armstrong, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep is off to a promising start against the American Nicole Gibbs, nabbing an early break to race ahead in the opening set. Updated
at 9.08pm BST 8.29pm BST
20:29 Tsitsipas’s section of the draw is even more wide open than it was before. He’s out. No 10 seed Roberto Bautista Agut is out after a highly entertaining five-set loss to Mikhail Kukushkin. That leaves only two seeds remaining in the section: No 24 Matteo Berrettini and No 28 Nick Kyrgios. 8.17pm BST
20:17 The second time’s the charm for Andrey Rublev. After getting broken while serving for the match, the young Russian breaks right back and serves out the match to seal a 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (7), 7-5 win over the eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. The cruel summer for the 21-year-old Greek and Australian Open semi-finalist continues: He was 32-11 on the year entering his French Open fourth-rounder against Stan Wawrinka, but has lost eight of 13 matches since including the last four on the trot. 8.02pm BST
20:02 That’s all from me. Bryan Armen Graham is at Flushing Meadows and will bring you all the action live from New York, including the finale of this dramatic match. Thanks for joining. Bye. 8.00pm BST
20:00 Tsitsipas breaks to stay in the match. Rublev’s fifth double fault opens the door and his second in a row widens that opening. That was a terrible second serve. Some Tsitsipas magic makes it 0-40 and a superb return from the Greek snatches the break. Suddenly it’s 5-5 with all to play for. Updated
at 8.13pm BST 7.57pm BST
19:57 Tsitsipas holds serve to love and shows no signs of the cramps that have been troubling him. Rublev will serve for the match now though. 7.55pm BST
19:55 Tsitsipas is all over the place in the fourth set against Rublev. He has played the last few games almost on one leg, with the medical staff on helping him carry on. He’s also called the umpire a weirdo and now finds himself 5-3 down and two sets to one down. He needs to muster something from somewhere or the No 8 seed is out. 7.51pm BST
19:51 Andujar wins the second set 7-6! Edmund has a terrible tie break record recently and an awful start to this one sees him 5-0 down in no time. He gets himself on the board but a poor backhand leaves him 6-1 behind. Six break points for Andujar and he takes the first on serve. That is poor from the British No 1. He was a break up and in control in that set but lost all momentum and was crushed in the tie break. 7.47pm BST
19:47 It’s a second set tie break for Edmund. He’s not great at these. 7.44pm BST
19:44 Naomi Osaka beats Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-7, 6-2! Blinkova opens with a double fault as the shadows peer across the court. It’s her fourth of the match. She avoids a fifth and Osaka finds the net with a forehand. That’s the champion’s 49th unforced error, to Blinkova’s 21. Her 50th takes the game to 30-all but a brutal forehand return from Osaka sets up match point. A fine rally ends with an unerring backhand from Osaka and that’s the match. Updated
at 7.48pm BST 7.38pm BST
19:38 Kyle Edmund has been broke back in the second set against Andujar and now finds himself at 5-5. Blinkova holds serve, and Osaka follows suit. It’s 5-2 to the world No 1 in the final set now. Can she close out the match. 7.34pm BST
19:34 Roberto Bautista Agut is out! A topsy turvy five-setter against Mikhail Kukushkin ends in defeat for the No 10 seed. That is a big win for the world No 47 from Kazakhstan, by a score of is 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. 7.31pm BST
19:31 Blinkova will not lie down. She fights hard and forces a break-back point but Oskaka holds firm and wins through to go 4-1 up. 7.25pm BST
19:25 Osaka puts her foot down and Blinkova struggles to cope. The defending champion saves break points on her own serve but escapes unscathed and harnesses that momentum to break her opponent’s. It’s 3-1 in the decider but we’ve seen Osaka surge and drop off before in this match. Updated
at 7.26pm BST 7.15pm BST
19:15 Edmund broke early in the second set and is showing little sign of letting up. He’s 4-2 and a set up on Andujar. Tsitsipas is back in trouble though. The third set tie break was as hard fought as the rest of the match and Rublev emerged the stronger, taking it 9-7 to go two sets to one up on the No 8 seed. Osaka and Blinkova are 1-1 in the deciding set."

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 17.38 BST Nearly 200 US cities have seen an increase in the number of days each year that soar beyond a heat index of 90F (32.2C) or higher, according to an analysis of the last four decades. “These extreme heat days are now comprising much of the summer for many cities in the south and south-west, while areas of the country that had relatively few summer days reach the 90F heat index in the past are now experiencing weeks of them,” said the report from the climate communications organization Climate Central. The higher temperatures are threatening public health and making outdoor activities and sports more dangerous. A July heatwave in the midwest and eastern US forced the cancellation of the New York City Triathlon, as well as other running and horse races. Climate Central used heat heat and humidity data for 239 cities and found 198 had an increase in the average number of days each year that felt 90F or hotter. They also found that 106 cities had an increase in “danger” days that felt 105F or hotter. Globally, temperatures are 1.5F higher than they were in the middle of the last century, as humans’ power plants, cars and ways of living contribute pollution that heats the planet. Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. It’s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time. This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities. Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US In parts of the Pacific north-west, days that were 90F or hotter increased substantially. In Yakima, Washington, they more than doubled, from 13 to 29. Salt Lake City, Utah, is seeing two weeks of days that hot. Fresno, California, saw a jump from 78 days to 93. In the south, extreme heat isn’t just in the summer. Austin, Texas, had 126 days that felt like 90F or hotter on average for the last five years. Savannah, Georgia, had 114. And Miami had 161. Danger days, which feel 105F or hotter, are rare but deadly. The National Weather Service can issue an “excessive heat warning” when two days in a row are forecast to be that hot without a cool night in between. With those temperatures, NWS warns people who don’t take precautions can become seriously ill or die. People in McAllen, Texas, have seen the biggest increase in danger days, climbing from 16 each year to 38.

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 23.09 BST It may placate those offended by the largesse of a golfer scooping $15m for tournament success to hear that the value of that prize doesn’t matter to the individual in question. When seeking to close out the Tour Championship, with the associated FedEx Cup bounty the standard reference point, Rory McIlroy’s focus was solely on professional entities. “I didn’t think about it once,” McIlroy insisted of the biggest pay day in golf’s history. “I was thinking about winning this tournament, winning the stroke average, getting back to second in the world. All those things are way more important to me. I realise I’m in a very privileged position that I can say that but at this stage in my career they are way more important to me.” Success at East Lake did, however, mean McIlroy could alter the life of someone close to him. The golfer’s best friend and caddie, Harry Diamond, will collect $1.5m in line with typical percentages bestowed on a bag man. This alliance, however, stretches beyond clubs and yardages. “Harry would be happy with anything,” said McIlroy. “It’s just so cool to be able to do this with him, aside from money or anything else. We are sharing these experiences; we watched Tiger win at East Lake a year ago and now we walk up to the last green and have that moment. That stuff is so cool and will stay with us forever. It’s worth way more than cheques.” The scoring average to which McIlroy referred has closed at under 70 and is the best in this PGA Tour season, earning him the Vardon Trophy. Having also won the Players Championship and Canadian Open, McIlroy has a case to challenge Brooks Koepka as the player of the year. From 19 PGA Tour starts in 2019, McIlroy notched 14 top 10s. Consistency of performance is linked to a stable state of mind. “Sometimes emotion has worked against me, and that’s the real reason that I maybe don’t show as much out there as I used to,” said the four-times major winner. “I don’t want to get too high and I don’t want to get too low. “If I needed to get emotional and get really riled up, this isn’t the sport to do that. I’m not a football player. It’s golf, and you sort of need to try to be pretty even-keeled the whole way through.” McIlroy, who now has only Koepka ahead of him in the world rankings, has scaled back matters of technicality. “I made a plan at the start of the year not to really focus or worry about my swing the weeks that I’m playing,” he said. “I try to do all of my work with my coach Michael Bannon on off weeks. I think you should do your work before the tournament starts, and then once you’re there, just go with what you have.” Lessons learned 11 months ago, when McIlroy was beaten to the Tour Championship by Tiger Woods, have also proved pivotal. “I had played in another final group and didn’t get the job done,” McIlroy recalled. “I said to myself that I had to make a few changes. I started to approach things differently.” A key example: stop treating Sundays like any other tournament round. “You have to be a realist and realise it’s not,” said McIlroy. “You have to prepare for it. Brooks went out there on Sunday in Memphis [at the World Golf Championship in July], shot 65 and just basically dominated the tournament, dominated me. I realised if I want to become the dominant player in the world again, I need to be more like that.” It was on day one at this year’s Open that we saw McIlroy stumble. His 79 in front of a stunned audience in his native Northern Ireland proved fatal to his chances of surviving for the weekend. When assessing McIlroy’s year, this looks the clear outlier. “It is and it isn’t; the first round is but I shot six under on the second day,” he said. “So the golf was in there but I had a horrific start. It was a bit of an anomaly, I feel. “People put their own importance on certain things, it’s all perception. The majors are very important to me, they are the biggest tournaments in the world and you want to win them but at the same time there are four chances a year. It’s not as if you don’t win them then there is nothing left to play for. It [success] is not guaranteed, there’s a law of averages.”"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 00.30 BST East Lake on Sunday afternoon was witness to something even more notable than delivery of the richest prize in golf. Rory McIlroy’s bounce, Rory McIlroy’s swagger, is back. And with good reason; a season featuring recurring success has now seen the Northern Irishman claim the FedEx Cup. McIlroy will insist the value of that win, $15m, is not crucial to him - and at his level it is not - but to the watching world the cheque added ribbons to this triumph. McIlroy joins Tiger Woods as the only multiple winners of the FedEx Cup. “I’m very proud of myself. I’m going to enjoy this one tonight,” said McIlroy while simultaneously delivering a smile which hinted at epic celebration. There will be for McIlroy’s best friend and caddie, Harry Diamond, too, a commonly underestimated influence in this team who now finds himself £1.5m richer. Sometimes the good guys win. The handicapped start afforded to players in the season-ending Tour Championship had caused elements of screaming from afar. McIlroy delivered the last laugh; his overall score would have been sufficient to win even if the 30-man field had started level. McIlroy’s closing round of 66 meant a four-stroke success over Xander Schauffele, with the champion’s 18-under-par aggregate requiring the context of a 10-under-par position before a ball was struck. McIlroy’s third round of 68, completed on Sunday morning after the lightning chaos which brought disruption a day earlier, was his highest tally of the week. If missing the cut at the Open Championship hurt McIlroy - and all the evidence suggested it did - he has responded in emphatic fashion. The one downside, if one can be derived from such a lucrative scene, is that the Masters is still more than seven months away. There were various strands of significance attached to McIlroy’s 17th PGA Tour win. The biggest was perhaps that he swatted aside Brooks Koepka, the world No 1 and his final-round playing partner. When the duo entered Sunday battle in Memphis at a World Golf Championship last month, Koepka prevailed pretty comfortably. This time McIlroy outscored Koepka by half a dozen round-four strokes. The 30-year-old did not appear remotely threatened. McIlroy also pointedly referenced 11 months ago at this venue, when he was afforded an unwanted front-row seat for Woods’s first success in five years. “I didn’t enjoy that walk last year like everyone else did,” McIlroy said. “I played terribly. I got myself into the final group and never took the fight to Tiger. Going up against the No 1 player in the world today, he got one over on me in Memphis and I wanted to try to sort of get some revenge. The final round in Memphis hurt a little bit. I didn’t take it to Brooks at all. “To play like that alongside Brooks and get the win, win the FedExCup, yeah, it’s awesome. It’s amazing how different things can be in a year.” Koepka and McIlroy had been embroiled in a tense battle until the 7th, when the former lost a ball from a wayward drive. A first double-bogey in 142 holes, a remarkable statistic, followed. As McIlroy birdied and bravely saved par at the 8th, Koepka needed snookers. The opposite transpired; Koepka dropped shots on three holes in a row from the 12th with Schauffele now McIlroy’s biggest danger. Schauffele got within two as McIlroy had three to play but birdies for the winner on the 17th and 18th added gloss to a dominant performance. At thirteen under, Koepka shared third with Justin Thomas. Paul Casey’s 72 left him fifth, with that over-par closing round not impacting on the Englishman’s willingness to wait to congratulate the champion, which was to his credit. Koepka displayed similar sportsmanship. “Rory played great golf, pretty much mistake free,” Koepka said. “It was impressive to watch. Hats off to him.” Next for Koepka, a five-week holiday. “I’m going to enjoy myself.” Much earlier the PGA Tour had confirmed all individuals hurt after the lightning strike at the course on Saturday had been released from hospital. “We are deeply grateful that the injuries were not more serious,” said the Tour. A happy ending there and another, rich one, for McIlroy. Money does not have to be a key motivator for such huge purses to resonate.. But that distinctive bounce, which set McIlroy apart from all others even in his youth, lingered more."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.03 BST This month on the reading group we’re going to have fun. The holiday season is drawing to a close, schools and colleges are starting again and the world is on fire. I’m not suggesting we hide from reality, but it might be useful to have something to offset the pain for a while. Think of it as a literary restorative. The form that tonic takes is entirely up to you. My first resources when it comes to fun books are always PG Wodehouse and Terry Pratchett and I’d be delighted to read either of them again. But we don’t have to choose something so explicitly humorous. There is plenty to be said for the warm glow that comes from reading a more quietly witty book such as Fup by Jim Dodge. Equally, we could go for something more noisily exuberant, such as Angela Carter’s Nights at the Circus, or something plain and beautiful, such as EL Carr’s A Month in the Country. Or we could lean the other way, into the caustic wit of an Elizabeth Taylor or the ghostly chill of a Shirley Jackson. Maybe your idea of fun is experiencing a gigantic Iain M Banks space opera or immersing yourself in the imagination of Ursula K Le Guin. Maybe it’s getting to the beating heart of a Zadie Smith or Michael Ondaatje novel. Perhaps it’s just the thrill of reading something as linguistically impressive as Virginia Woolf. This could even be an opportunity to revisit Dickens. (There are few greater pleasures in literature than the arrival on the scene of Betsey Trotwood, after all.) Or at least, that’s my opinion. But now it’s up to you. Any book that you regard as fun is fair game and nominating is easy. Just add the title in the comments below – if you can also provide reasons, so much the better. I’ll put all the contenders in a hat towards the end of the week and announce the winner shortly afterwards. Let’s enjoy ourselves."

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 18.05 BST David Koch, who has died aged 79, was ranked as the eleventh richest person in the world. Alongside his older brother Charles, he built his family’s company into one of the US’s biggest conglomerates and each brother’s share was estimated to be worth more than $50bn. They used their fortunes to influence American politics in a rightward direction following their libertarian ideology. Charles wanted to “minimise the role of government and maximise the role of the private economy ... and personal freedoms”, but the brothers’ philosophy was self-serving, protecting their worth and working against regulation of their business interests. David was the more public of the two, his philanthropy extending beyond the brothers’ massive spending on rightwing thinktanks, academic programmes, activist organisations and campaign funding; he was a major donor to the arts and medicine, especially in New York, where he maintained homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. He moved between them, Aspen (Colorado), Palm Beach (Florida) and a yacht in the Mediterranean while Charles lived in a walled estate in Wichita, Kansas, where Koch Industries has its headquarters. And though most of their work was behind-the-scenes, in 1980 he was the Libertarian party candidate for vice-president of the US. Charles and David were two of the four sons of Fred and Mary (nee Robinson) Koch. Fred was an engineer who made his fortune from inventing an improved refining process to extract petrol from crude oil. His libertarian ideas came from the efforts of larger oil companies to stymie his firm’s growth using government-regulated patent laws; his hatred of socialism came from his experience, after building refineries in Britain, of supervising the construction of the Soviet Union’s largest installation. When the Russians decided they could proceed on their own, Fred turned to Nazi Germany, with whom his firm Winkler-Koch collaborated from 1934 on building refineries. In 1958 he was a founding member of the ultra-rightwing John Birch Society, dedicated to fighting the infiltration of American politics by communists, among whose number it identified the Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower. David was born in Wichita. Fred was a harsh father, encouraging competition among his sons, from which Charles emerged as the undisputed leader, and David his second, while David’s twin, William, fell behind and the eldest son, Frederick, described as being most like their mother, a Wellesey College graduate with artistic interests, was the odd one out. They were subjected to frequent corporal punishment, as well as hard labour on the family farm. David went to Deerfield academy, in Massachusetts, and then, like his father and two of his brothers, took an engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where David, 6ft 5in tall, played basketball, setting an MIT scoring record with 41 points in one game. After adding a master’s degree in 1963, he worked for engineering companies in Cambridge and New York. When Fred Sr died in 1967, Charles replaced him as chairman and chief executive of the renamed Koch Industries, and in 1970 David joined to open a New York office. In 1979 David became president of Koch Engineering, later Koch Chemical Technology, and in 1981 became number two to Charles as executive vice-president of Koch Industries. No longer bound to his father’s political dictates, David broke with the John Birch Society over its support for the Vietnam war. He became a backer of the Freedom School, which advocated the free-market theories of Friedrich Hayek, which were such an influence on Thatcherism in the UK. Although he and Ed Clark, the Libertarian candidate for president in 1980, attracted only 1.1% of the vote, the Kochs’ focus on politics led to a family feud that lasted for 20 years. Before their father’s death, William is said to have recalled participating with Charles and David in an attempt to blackmail their oldest brother into relinquishing his inheritance by threatening to tell their father he was gay, which he denied. William regretted his actions, and in 1980 he and Frederick sued for control of the company, alleging Charles and David’s political interests were damaging its business. In 1983 they settled for a buyout of $1.1bn, but in 1985 they sued again, claiming their brothers had undervalued the company’s worth in the settlement. The case was eventually settled in Charles and David’s favour in 1999, but not until 2001 were they publicly reconciled. Fred Sr’s will required the sons to give the interest on their inheritance to charity; thus their political donations went to organisations structured as tax-exempt charities or academic institutions. In the 1980s, Richard Fink, at the Koch-funded Cato Institute, developed a three-stage plan for activism. It started with the creation of an intellectual platform for ideas, at places they funded such as George Mason University. Then thinktanks would turn those ideas into policies to be brought to political reality by advocacy groups, which David called “a sales force”. Although the Kochs strongly denied any connection, the nascent Tea Party movement was backed by another Koch-funded group, Americans for Prosperity. This worked in parallel with the American Legislative Exchange Council, through which the Kochs funded campaigns for Republican control of state legislatures. In 1991, David narrowly escaped death as a passenger on a US Air jet that collided with a small commuter plane while landing at Los Angeles airport, killing 34 people. In 1992 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which he received treatment for many years. His private life, which had been compared with Hugh Hefner’s, slowed down, and in 1996 he married Julia Flesher, an assistant at the Adolfo fashion brand. Spurred by court decisions overturning limits on political spending, the Kochs became power brokers in Republican politics. Bitterly opposed to President Barack Obama, they poured money into the 2010 Congressional elections, and when the Republican John Boehner took the gavel as Speaker of the House in 2011, David was present in his office. Their influence was revealed when Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, took a phone call from a Koch representative, agreeing to a plan to remove collective bargaining from state employees. The caller was an impostor who made the tape public. In the 2016 presidential campaign, the Kochs spent nearly $1bn on Republican candidates, but not on Donald Trump, whose protectionism was antithetical to their beliefs. Though David attended the victory party at Mar-a-Lago after Trump’s election, their criticism of the new president saw Trump label them “not true Republicans”, calling them “a total joke in Republican circles and highly overrated”.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.55 BST As a child, Laura craved unconditional love. But instead of cuddles and family outings, her lasting memories are of bitter rows. “My mum never wanted children,” she says. “She told me that the only reason she didn’t get an abortion was she found out about the pregnancy too late.” Laura’s dad left when she was very young, which she thinks made her mother resentful. “She had to stay and be the responsible mum, which she hated. On one occasion my grandparents took me away and I remember thinking: this is what family should be like.” The relationship dissolved completely when Laura was a teenager. “Mum’s first love was always men, and when I was 15 she moved to Africa for a boyfriend without telling me.” It’s something she found impossible to forgive, especially as there has never been an explanation or apology. “She has contacted me since but always asks for money. That’s why I made the decision to cut all ties with her.” Laura puts her mother’s behaviour down to a traumatic upbringing, but she can’t make the same excuses for her father. “Dad had a lovely childhood, but he has no emotions or empathy for anyone. We haven’t spoken in seven years.” Although she is close to his parents and they encouraged her and her father to repair the damaged relationship, it brought her nothing but more hurt. “After he left my mum, he went on to have a new family; that was really hard for me to handle, when he’d made so little effort with me. “My issues with my mum and dad have badly affected my mental health all throughout my life,” she continues. “I see a therapist regularly now to try to help me deal with the emotions.” When she gets married next year, neither of her parents will be invited. “I grew up thinking I did something wrong for my parents not to want me. My only regret is not telling my dad how much I hated him. I don’t hate my mum; I just feel sorry for her and I wish she could see what she’s done.” Ending all contact with a parent may sound extreme, but for Alice it was an act of self-preservation. “My dad left when I was eight and I haven’t spoken to my mum once since I moved to Germany 10 years ago,” she explains. “She wasn’t maternal and had a really bad temper, which she took out on me. She would never be affectionate and I felt unloved.” Like Laura, Alice believes her mother may have had a miserable childhood, which meant she lacked the emotional tools to be a good parent. “After I grew up and had my own daughter, our relationship got even worse,” she says. “I became more aware of how unimportant I was to her life.” Alice’s mother never came to see her or her granddaughter, but she did form a close bond with her son’s new family. “It hurt me that she made an effort to spend time with my brother’s children and not mine. Over time I have come to terms with the fact that she never loved me. I don’t hate her or feel sorry for her; I just don’t want her in my life any more.” Andy hasn’t spoken to his mother for 25 years, after they stopped communicating in his early 20s. For him the problem was a lack of respect and common values. “I grew up in a ‘children should be seen and not heard’ household, where my parents’ opinion was the only right one. We would have dinner in silence and my parents never encouraged me in my interests or activities.” He says he was never praised for his achievements, only criticised for doing things wrong. “Whatever I did, it was never good enough. If I did well at something, my dad would always have to prove he was better.” The house rules were strict and he was sent to bed by 8pm every night, even at the age of 16. But instead of sleeping, Andy found himself listening to the radio to escape the boredom. He quickly became interested in current affairs and politics, which gave him a new insight into the world. “It made me realise that my parents’ views were snobby, sexist, bigoted and racist. I was never allowed to voice any opinion that contradicted their views or I’d be sent to my room. It made me lose respect for them.” Andy’s dad died when he was 18, but he felt no real sense of loss. “We were living in the same house but we hadn’t had a conversation for over a year. I can’t say I regretted not making up with him. He was miserable to be around.” Several years later, Andy graduated from university and bought a house. “I was so proud but my mum told me it was horrible. She said it looked like a council house and asked why I wanted to live in a slum.” As his career advanced, she became more critical and constantly compared him with his brother. “I was 21 and felt successful but she was ashamed of everything I did because it didn’t fit her snobbish ideals.” Eventually, he stopped contacting both his mother and brother, and has never looked back. “It wasn’t really a difficult decision to make because we had nothing in common and they didn’t accept me or my life choices.” Andy understands why some people see this as a surprising decision, but has no interest in sustaining a relationship for the sake of it. “I feel like seeing your parents under duress or out of duty is wrong. If you have made no effort to build a relationship with your children, I don’t think you can expect them to be there.” For other families, the rift is a result of the parents’ divorce. Helen lost contact with two of her four adult children this year, after ending an emotionally abusive relationship with their father. “Since we separated in 2011, it’s been a slow process of parental alienation,” she says. “My son hasn’t spoken to me since April and my middle daughter is now ghosting me on every channel of communication.” She believes her former partner has used the same manipulation tactics on her children as those that destroyed their marriage. “Once the kids got older and I developed my own life and interests, my ex became controlling and tried to stop me from doing the things I liked,” she explains. During a period of gaslighting that spanned many years, she says he told lies about her behaviour to friends and family. “Once he told them I was drunk and suicidal and I’d gone missing. In reality I’d gone to the supermarket. When I joined a local band he told everyone I was crazy and that I wanted to run away and become famous.” Over time, her husband’s side of the story was believed and Helen began feeling alienated from her family. “I sadly lost my mum a few years ago and my dad is a man’s man and took my ex’s side.” The divorce impacted the children hugely, and damaged them emotionally. Despite making every effort to build bridges with her children, she admits she doesn’t know what their father has told them. “He has always manufactured an argument before parties and celebrations, to prevent me from coming to the event. He also accused me of having an affair when I got a new partner, even though I never cheated on him,” she says. The relationships with her two estranged children became so strained that she wasn’t given an opportunity to discuss what had happened. “The only explanation they’ve ever given me is that I don’t care about them or that I treat them as little kids.” Though losing contact has been an extremely painful experience, she doesn’t blame her children. “It’s not their fault – they’ve learned it from their dad,” she says. “They’re like goldfish swimming in a tank where someone keeps adding a tiny bit of colour every day, until they start to see things in a completely different way.” She would love the opportunity to reconnect with her children, but doesn’t see how it will happen. “At the moment I feel like I am standing outside and they’re inside a glass room. I really miss them.” Some details have been changed. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/27/women-theatre-metoo-movement-sexy-lamp-bitter-wheat-harvey,"The Weinstein scandal has inspired several new plays ranging from sharp satire to crass comedy. As the mogul heads to trial, we gauge theatre’s response Arifa Akbar Tue 27 Aug 2019 06.00 BST Katie Arnstein tells a story of a day at drama school when a tutor told her to perform her graduation show in a bra “because I’m a blonde with a big chest”. It is one of several experiences that informed Arnstein’s solo show Sexy Lamp, performed at the Edinburgh fringe this month. The title comes from writer Kelly Sue DeConnick’s theory that, if you can replace a female character with a lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft. Arnstein wrote her play, which features shocking revelations about auditions and casting call notices, because she felt so galvanised by the #MeToo movement that followed the numerous allegations of rape and sexual assault levelled at Harvey Weinstein since 2017. (Allegations he continues to deny in the run-up to his trial in September.) “I was inspired by the strength shown by people who have called out abuse in the acting industry,” Arnstein says. “This play is my version of the #MeToo story, my journey of being an actor and the challenges I continue to face because of my gender.” She is not alone in putting abuse on the stage. Several playwrights have taken on the Weinstein story directly, treating the allegations in imaginative and sometimes incendiary ways. Among the first was David Mamet, known for his preoccupation with power and its abuse, often refracted through lethally predatory masculinity in his plays. He announced in early 2019 that he was working on Bitter Wheat, a “dark farce” starring John Malkovich as a shamed movie mogul called Barney Fein, who has uncanny similarities to Weinstein. Bitter Wheat landed with a thud this summer in London. But Steven Berkoff beat Mamet to the first, no-holds-barred play enacting the story from the predator’s perspective with Harvey, a scrappy 45-minute monologue that was still being workshopped when it was performed in February at the Playground theatre in London. In a static performance, Berkoff sat in the centre of an almost bare stage wearing tracksuit bottoms and T-shirt. Delivering a monologue that was part-confession, part-justification of his acts, Berkoff’s narcissistic, misogynistic character attempted to implicate the women who met him in hotel rooms. The monologue was interspersed with bilious summaries of abusive encounters, from hotel-room assaults to grim masturbatory episodes. The staging of Mamet and Berkoff’s dramas raised questions of timing and sensitivity. Did we want to be inside the head of a sexual predator at a time when the unheard stories of women, and victims, were beginning to be dramatised? Other directors and playwrights mobilised plans of action to foreground women’s perspectives. Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court, curated Snatches, a series of monologues for BBC4 with an all-female lineup of writers, directors and actors. Among them was Compliance, a drama written by Abi Morgan about a young female actor meeting a senior producer in a hotel bedroom to “run through a scene”. Its lead was played by Romola Garai, who was among the first women to speak out about Weinstein, describing an audition that took part in his hotel room at the Savoy when he opened the door to his room dressed in just a bathrobe. Garai, 18 at the time, reflected on how it left her feeling “violated” but that such behaviour was accepted in an industry that was “very very very misogynistic”. There were signs of a reckoning for silenced women from the past, too, the most prominent of which was Emilia, co-produced by Nica Burns, in which Morgan Lloyd Malcolm dramatised the life of Emilia Bassano, a poet and contemporary of William Shakespeare who, Lloyd Malcolm argues, was the unacknowledged inspiration for his plays. Commissioned in 2016, it was written after the Weinstein case made headlines, says Burns. “Emilia could not get published in her time because she was a woman. It’s all about women wanting their voices to be heard.” Rose McGowan, who alleges she was raped by Weinstein, performed a one-woman show at Edinburgh this month, taking the audience “on a healing journey of discovery”. More #MeToo plays by female writers are in the pipeline. Emily McLaughlin, head of new work at the National Theatre, speaks of an exceptional play in development by a writer “who has found a brilliant device to look at sexual abuse and harassment in the film industry”. In the US, there has been an assortment of #MeToo-related dramas, including The Pussy Grabber Plays, inspired by the stories of women who had accused Donald Trump of sexual assault or harassment. Its co-creators, Kate Pines and Sharyn Rothstein, distilled their testimonies into drama. “I felt very much that the women who had come forward over Trump were the precursors to the women who came forward over Weinstein,” says Pines. “The stories about Trump had been largely ignored and relegated to a footnote of the elections.” Natasha Stoynoff, a journalist whose story was dramatised in The Pussy Grabber Plays, thought it was important for her account to be preserved in a more complex way than she had seen it presented in news clips. “Kate and Sharyn wanted to go deeper into the women’s stories … We’d all become headshots flashed on a TV screen, like victims of a serial killer.” She hopes it might serve as a comfort to women in similar situations – and help men, too. “If even one man walks out of the theatre more aware of his own actions regarding women and boundaries, that’s progress,” she says. Pines has reservations over Bitter Wheat. “I’m not interested in his perspective. The playwright Mathilde Dratwa has written A Play About David Mamet Writing a Play About Harvey Weinstein and, between the two, I’m much more tempted to see that.” Should men be telling women’s #MeToo stories at all? Of course, says Featherstone. “We can’t start censoring writers.” But she adds: “It is ironic that the only two plays which deal head-on with the predator are by two middle-aged men.” Rothstein thinks this is symptomatic of imbalances in the industry. “The first major West End production of the #MeToo story is told by a white American male. This fact alone is indicative of a much deeper issue and the way in which the system is structured. It’s not that Mamet shouldn’t be writing about this incredibly topical issue. It’s that his play should not be the only one that gets staged in the West End. You need everyone’s perspective, including those of the survivors of abuse.” Liv Warden’s play Anomaly, staged at the Red Lion theatre, London, in January, was about a fictional shamed media mogul. Warden made the decision not to have him appear on stage. He is a silenced character and his three daughters, who have to deal with the fallout of his misconduct, are the focus of her plot. “When [Weinstein] was arrested,” she says, “I saw that he had a wife and two young children. One of my first thoughts was about them and how this was going to change their lives. I wanted to show the grey area. There is not the victim-predator divide here and there are questions of why the women connected with these men didn’t say anything.” But there are women in theatre who feel men’s stories about this subject deserve to be heard, too, as long as they are delivered responsibly. Priscilla Holbrook is part of a production that dramatises the lives of male sex offenders in a rural American community. America Is Hard to See, which was staged at the Edinburgh fringe, is set to music and lyrics composed by Holbrook and is an investigative theatre piece based on verbatim interviews. “We see the victims mainly through the men’s stories but this does not minimise them,” says Holbrook. What is essential for drama about sex abuse, she adds, is for it to be attuned to the prospect of retraumatising those who have experienced it. “You have to ask, ‘Does a piece of art retraumatise or does it nudge you to a bigger, expanded place?’” A hotel room scene in Bitter Wheat shows Malkovich’s character attempting to have coercive sex with a young actress. “It’s such an important scene,” says Burns. “I bet it’s quite an eye-opener for men because they don’t normally see what it’s like for her – or they profess not to.” Yet Berkoff and Mamet’s dramas seemed so closely tethered to real events that they offer little insights beyond what we already know from news stories. “When something has been in the news, what does theatre add to it?” asks Featherstone. In recent years, she has seen “a new anger and fearlessness in women’s stories. And a sense of not needing to be liked or even a desire to create likable female characters on stage. The work that has been talked about since #MeToo was already in development before the Weinstein case. He was brought down because change was happening.” Lynette Linton, artistic director of the Bush theatre, London, says the #MeToo movement was slow to embrace the stories of women of colour. “At the beginning, its focus was American white women,” she says. These stories need to be told in all their intersectional complexity and fullness. Sexual harassment is a subject that’s simply not going to go away, says Burns: “I’m sure there will be more women writing these stories. Let’s not push them to do it too quickly.” • Sexy Lamp is at Upstairs at the Western, Leicester, 12-13 September. Bitter Wheat is at the Garrick theatre, London, until 21 September."
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/26/you-might-see-yourself-in-it-behind-new-york-citys-biggest-ever-mural,"Spanish artist Domingo Zapata has brought a record-breaking new piece of art to Times Square and hopes it might cause crowds to pause Nadja Sayej Tue 27 Aug 2019 07.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 20.09 BST Times Square is not exactly a hotbed of high culture. As Fran Lebowitz once said: “If you’re a New Yorker, and you run into another New Yorker in Times Square, it’s like running into someone at a gay bar in the 1970s – you make up excuses about why you’re there.” Now, this tourist-heavy hub in the center of midtown Manhattan is changing – it’s starting to see more art. Spanish artist Domingo Zapata has just finished painting the largest mural New York City has ever seen, hanging 300 feet high on the building at One Times Square. It took him three weeks to paint and will hang here for the next few months. But Times Square? Really? “I thought, ‘Let’s bring something non-commercial to the most commercial part of the world’,” said Zapata. “It’s important for people to take a few minutes and enjoy it. It’s about dreams and how everything is possible. You might see yourself in it and it might make your day more beautiful.” Roughly 340,000 people, many of them tourists, plow through Times Square every day – roughly 50m visit annually – so, this isn’t exactly where one expects to find any artwork (besides the postcard landscapes, maybe, or the naked cowboy). “That’s why we brought it here, it was about time,” said Zapata. “Even advertisements were more artistic before, now everything is data. What happened to the natural attraction to things?” The artwork is essentially about gratitude. “Stop for a second, we’re going too fast with social media. What happened to slowing down and appreciating what’s with you, right now?” he asks. “You might enjoy it.” The mural is covering the LED screens at One Times Square, a 25-story skyscraper owned by Jamestown, which has enormous LED walls handled by the advertising firm, New Tradition. It’s where the New Years’ Eve ball has dropped every year since 1907. This is also where it costs an upward of $1m per year to advertise. Zapata previously did a series of video artworks last year at Times Square, before Jamestown approached him to do a bigger project. “They wanted me to paint a mural where the advertising would be, to do something different,” he said. “They thought I was the artist crazy enough to go up there.” And it did seem a little crazy, considering he had an unexpected hitch. “The first day we got stuck up on the rig for three hours at 200 feet high and lost power, a storm was coming and our power shut down,” said Zapata. “I asked myself, ‘Why am I doing this? What was I thinking?’” Zapata’s towering mural has hints of European modern art. It’s an expressionist romp through familiar symbols (guitars, like the ones Pablo Picasso painted), dapper men in suits (like that of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec) and broad-stroked flowers (like the ones by Henri Matisse). The mural stretches across 15-storys of the building, covering the west, east and south sides of One Times Square. It was created by a team of 25 people, including a handful of painting assistants. It’s not entirely painted however, some of the artwork is printed onto the vinyl. Crank up your neck to read phrases, like “Life is a dream” and “Everybody dies but not everybody lives.” “What I’m trying to say is, here is the most commercial, aggressively financial area in the planet, where people are go, go, go,” said Zapata. “You don’t pay attention to the fact that maybe you don’t need these big, huge dreams, but this combination of the little things and the details. Stop for a second and appreciate what you have. It will give you a big reward.” Before it was created, the largest mural in New York City was a 20,000 square foot painting in the West Village created by Argentinian artist Magda Love alongside local high school students. From a political video art piece by Alfredo Jaar in 1987, to the more recent video art at midnight series, Times Square billboards have seen their fair share of artwork. Recently, Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager took over an LED screen wrapped around the corner of 47th Street and Broadway to promote his new hotel with the Sila Sveta design studio to bring back “the sophisticated glitz and high romance” of Times Square in the 1940s. In the months after the artwork is taken down, Zapata’s vinyl mural will be cut into 6x6ft squares and donated to charities to support art education. Among them, he’ll donate to Pope Francis’ art education foundation, Scholas Occurrentes and Elevate, a New York organization that brings art to inner city schools. “Art is a great therapy to understand you can make your own place in the world, your own magical place,” said Zapata. “I am trying to help others see something positive.” Just as he painted a mural live during the Concert for Peace in Madrid this summer, Zapata is carrying on the same sort of vibe. “I like to send a message of positive energy, no?” says the artist. “I always say, a lot of painters make a statement of what is wrong in the world, I don’t know about politics or how to make the economy better, but I know how to make it more beautiful for people who know how to make it a better place.” “That’s my goal,” he says. “There’s a lot to be worried about; we can’t change our world in one day, week or year, but generationally, we can little by little,” said Zapata. “Positive energy is good, but people are used to negativity. In the news, everything is a disaster but not everything is a disaster. There are beautiful things we don’t pay attention to.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/26/cezanne-at-the-whitworth-review-manchester,"Whitworth Art Gallery, ManchesterFrom the tenderness of parenthood to shattering images of death, Cézanne’s drawings are charged with an electrifying power Jonathan Jones Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.19 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.26 BST The Whitworth Art Gallery exists for “the perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester”, in the words of its Victorian founder, and in that spirit it has one of the most democratic approaches in the country to its collection of prints and drawings. Anyone can make an appointment to explore its boxes of works by the likes of Turner and Blake. Its new exhibition Cézanne at the Whitworth celebrates that collection, and a remarkable gift to it that proves the spirit of Victorian philanthropy is alive. The story starts with a radical masterpiece the Whitworth bought in 1927 when many Britons would have regarded it as a worthless scrap of paper. Paul Cézanne’s Study of Trees still challenges today. Black strands like fluttering seaweed mark the tracks of thin, twisting branches in empty space while watery touches of olive and orange hint at foliage. The art of summer is usually imagined as a sensual picnic beside a sun-kissed sea – Luxe, Calme et Volupté, “luxury, peace and voluptuousness”, as Matisse, quoting Baudelaire, called an ecstatic nude beach scene. There’s a romp of a drawing by Picasso in the Whitworth’s show that delivers that Riviera vibe, and then some. Two women are bathing naked in an abundance of curvy lines that communicates the artist’s greedy delight in their bodies. But this gleefully erotic Mediterranean scene just underlines that where Picasso leaps in, Cézanne holds back, staring, thinking, and alone. If there’s a melancholy undertow to this exhibition, that is appropriate, for it commemorates the generosity of art dealer Karsten Schubert who died in July. Before his death at the age of 57 from cancer, Schubert gifted the Whitworth his collection of works on paper by Cézanne. These are true treasures. Subtle masterpieces of drawing and printmaking, they pack more thought and feeling into the merest sketch than most artists have ever been able to communicate in a massive installation. Cézanne once claimed his contemporary Monet was “only an eye”. No one could say that of the drawings here. Cézanne is never just eye but a complex brain, and an even more complex soul. Everything he ever drew is a silent, still explosion of insight and passion. Two drawings given by Schubert portray Cézanne’s young son, Paul junior: in a little sketch on blue paper he watches Paul sleep and all the tenderness, anxiety and hopes of parenthood seem to fill each pencil mark. That intensity and clarity transfigures a drawing of a skull that Cézanne made in the 1890s into a shattering modern memento mori. Skulls and skeletons were an artistic cliche by the late 19th century. Even Van Gogh lapses into morbid tomfoolery in his 1886 painting of a skeleton smoking a cigarette. But Cézanne sees it as planes of shade and shadow. Flat blocks of pencil work create the solidity of its cranium and the pools of its vacant eye sockets. It is a dazzling still life study – an intensely fresh act of observation. By seeing it like this he frees the skull of hokey symbolism. Paradoxically, that lets the reality of death hit us afresh. About 20 years before he drew that proto-Cubist skull, Cézanne etched his 1873 print Armand Guillaumin with the Hanged Man. This image of a fellow artist haunted by an executed corpse in the background is typical of Cézanne’s romantic obsession with death and crime – the dark side of himself that he conquers in his study of a skull only to make its mortal menace more real. Cézanne turned symbols into things, and things into art. In the process he invented modernism. His art is electrifyingly tense because the transformations his pencil creates are never easy. Death is still death when you see it objectively. And the human body is still the human body, however hard you try to see it as a formal nude. At the heart of this exhibition are works in which Cézanne tries to master his turbulent and enigmatic sexuality. His study After the Antiquity: Crouching Venus, which dates from about 1894-7, is a close-up drawing of a broken statue. He looks at it formally, mapping its shape with apparent objectivity. Yet the marble seems alive. Venus has a creased, rucked-up stomach. Is she stone or flesh? Can the artist bring his nude to life, like the sculptor Pygmalion in ancient myth? In two copies given by Schubert of Cézanne’s great lithograph The Bathers (Large Plate), his attempt to transcend the pain of desire and enter an abstract realm of pastoral peace produces a modernist masterpiece. Four young men who’ve been bathing pose and cavort in a fiery Provence landscape. Behind them is an extinct volcano whose flat top is oddly truncated, maybe suggesting impotence. The heat has broken everything into hot hard impulses of colour. Only the bodies of the youths are soft and flowing. Is this a memory of the artist’s own youth in this southern landscape? Here it becomes an Arcadia where everything is suspended. Cézanne has taken care to hide every penis, but one young man is gazing at another who is pulling on his pants. Cézanne was a confused and troubled man whose anxieties shudder through his Mediterranean Arcadia. This makes him not just the godfather of modern art but one of the truest chroniclers of modern anguish. What a gift to Manchester and to us all. At the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, until 1 March."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/bradley-wiggins-pursue-career-social-worker,"• 2012 Tour winner wants to put sporting success behind him• ‘I don’t give a shit about my cycling career. I’m detached from it’ PA Media Tue 27 Aug 2019 01.02 BST


First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.01 BST Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he is taking a degree in social work as he looks to redefine himself after his cycling career. The 39-year-old was the first Briton to win the Tour de France in 2012 and took Olympic time trial gold just days later, but said he no longer wants to be defined by his sporting success and is instead trying to find ways to help people. “I don’t give a shit about my cycling career now,” Wiggins told the Big Issue magazine. “I’m just detached from it, I don’t want to live off the back of it. I live off of being me, and I’m happy in my own skin.” Wiggins, who briefly attempted to become an elite rower after his cycling career ended, has now found success as a pundit for Eurosport, and during the Tour this year he drew rave reviews for his commentary when riding on a motorbike, laughing and joking with riders in the peloton. However Wiggins, who had a difficult relationship with his estranged father after growing up in Kilburn, said he also wants to move into social work. “When I was offered a TV role I wasn’t sure I wanted to do it,” he said. “It took me a while to find myself, redefine myself, and come back to cycling without an ego. So now I can do the TV job, but I’ve also enrolled to do an Open University degree in social work. I want to help people. “Those horrific things I saw when I was growing up ... nothing can shock me now, and I want to use that mental toughness working as a social worker. And when people say, ‘Oh you’re that cyclist’, I’ll say: ‘No, that was a few years ago. I’m a social worker now.’” Wiggins’s reputation has suffered some damage since his retirement. The Fancy Bears hackers revealed details of therapeutic use exemptions Wiggins was granted ahead of some of his biggest races, including the 2012 Tour, while an investigation into the contents of a jiffy bag delivered to the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné for his use was inconclusive. Wiggins called the investigation a “malicious witch-hunt” at the time. The interview in the Big Issue will appear just a few days after it was announced that Team Wiggins Le Col, the professional development team Wiggins formed in 2015, will close its doors at the end of the season, having helped a number of young British riders reach the WorldTour. Wiggins was the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2012, with his Tour success helping to transform the popularity of cycling and his pose on a throne in front of Hampton Court Palace after his Olympic gold becoming one of the defining images of the London Games – as were his late-night celebrations. But Wiggins is clear that is now all behind him. “It’s nice to be remembered but I can’t keep waltzing in with a rock’n’roll haircut and a suede suit on, drunk. I’ve moved on from that person. Everything ends, everything has to end.”"

I laughed out loud – for all Poldark’s intentional light relief, it is the earnest parts that make me want to giggle, although until now it has somehow managed to stay on the right side of ridiculous. It was the last ever episode – supposedly – of the gloriously entertaining show that has run on BBC One for five series. It has pushed me to my limits with its jumpy approach to time and ludicrous storylines, and the finale nearly sent me over the edge. And yet, like that moment when Dwight Enys grabbed George as he was about to go over the Cornish clifftop in episode three, they pulled it back. Just. Five months have passed since the penultimate episode. Morwenna is heavily pregnant, Caroline is still – implausibly – on at Dwight about being in love with Kitty Despard and Ross is acting strangely (as he warned Dwight he would). Demelza knows he is up to something, but suspects that something is troublemaker Tess Tregidden – devastatingly confirmed to her when she follows him. Heartbroken, she packs for Killewarren, Caroline’s house. “When did I lose you, Ross? I look in your face and see a stranger.” He can’t tell her the truth, which is that he has infiltrated a French gang – ahead of a French invasion – and stringing Tess along is supposedly all part of it. But the invasion is on – and before the peace agreement is to be signed! French general Jules Toussaint turns up at Nampara, news of which finds its way back to George and the slave traders at Trenwith. They are delighted that Ross appears to be betraying his country. But Ross – of course – has a plan. Dwight has to hide under a floorboard, and Zacky and the Carne boys have to do something with gunpowder. With Poldarkian speed, it all gets going – Ross and the general discuss plans, while Dwight, hidden under the floor, takes notes. But the document – bound for Wickham in London – is intercepted. Huzzah! Proof that Ross is a traitor. But what’s this? He is actually acting as an undercover agent? “Damn him. So he’ll be crowned as a hero,” sulks George. Unless they inform the general that he’s been had, they decide, treacherously. There follows a sequence as hammy and cheesy as a croque monsieur. “Forgive me if your carpet is stained, madam,” says Toussaint to Demelza, now he knows of Ross’s double-crossing, “but I must perform a small execution before we resume our conversation.” Demelza, always the quickest-witted Poldark, pretends to side with the Frenchman. “Can you truly think to rid me of this fiend?” she says, standing between her husband and Toussaint, stalling for time. For some reason – something to do with artistry – Toussaint decides not to shoot Ross and have a duel instead. Their moonlit swordfight seems to go on for so long that by the time Hanson decides to take matters into his own hands and shoot Ross himself, you’re almost cheering him on. And then George appears in his Tarantino moment, guns blazing. “I’d rather you kill the other one but we mustn’t be greedy,” says Ross, before they discuss whether to finish Hanson off and dispose of the bodies. If you have stuck with Poldark this far, you have a fairly high tolerance for such nonsense. There is a kind of rapprochement between George and Ross, arch-enemies all this time. “I’m indebted to you, nonetheless,” says Ross, “which is not a position I relish.” George smirks: “Whereas I revel in it.” There is just time to wrap it all up, and fairly satisfying it is too. Morwenna and Drake have a baby girl. Dwight and Caroline have a most touching scene, confronting the grief of losing their daughter but with hope for their future. Sam and the sweet-faced Rosina get married. Geoffrey Charles has his place back at military school. Even Valentine (Ross’s secret son) gets his own mine – but not the knowledge of his true father. George, his supposed dad, asks the Poldarks not to see him any more. “He is, after all, no relation,” he says, all pride and gritted teeth. Most importantly, Horace, Caroline’s pug, seems to have recovered from the poisoning incident. Which just leaves Ross and Demelza. With everything they’ve been through – and put the other through – they end the show as equals. Ross says she saved his life. “As you saved mine, long ago. When you took me from a dog fight, made me your scullery maid, and then your wife,” she replies. Quite why, even now, she puts up with him – he’s going off to be a spy in France while she’s pregnant – is one of the enduring mysteries of her character. Still, it allows the tantalising prospect that this isn’t the end, not really. She expects him back for the harvest (a chance for him to get that scythe out again). One last bit of Poldark smouldering: “I swear to you, my love, I will return.” It’s silly, eye-roll-inducing and the perfect farewell."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 17.02 BST Earlier today I set you this puzzle: You are in a big city where all the streets go in one of two perpendicular directions. You take your car from its parking place and drive on a tour of the city such that you do not pass through the same intersection twice and return back to where you started. If you made 100 left turns, how many right turns did you make? Solution 96 or 104 right turns. The path driven by the car does not cross itself. So, when considering the direction of the car, every right turn cancels out a left turn. The net change in direction of the car is 360 degrees (which is 4 left turns, or 4 right turns). So either this was done by four extra left turns (in which case there were 96 right turns) or there were four extra right turns (in which case there were 104 right turns.) The question made it appear that there was only one answer. Gold stars to those who got both of them. I hope you enjoyed the puzzle, I’ll be back in two weeks. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/07/formula-one-saudi-arabia-grand-prix-cash-reputation,"For all the talk of social change in Saudi Arabia, the beneficiaries of a grand prix would be F1’s coffers and the country’s ruler Contact author Wed 7 Aug 2019 13.17 BST


Last modified on Wed 7 Aug 2019 19.35 BST Was it really only last year that Formula One’s owner, Liberty Media, was making its pious announcement that “grid girls” would no longer be a part of its stewardship of this most woke of all sports? “We feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values,” intoned F1’s managing director of commercial operations back then, “and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms.” But which society? Formula One takes gazillions to race in so many different types of society. It feels difficult to apply any standard across the board. For instance, things that might be acceptable in the land of Silverstone, such as human rights and democracy, are less acceptable in the land of, say, the Shanghai International Circuit. Even so, news that Liberty is in talks to hold an F1 race in Saudi Arabia adds real moral heft to its self-styled position as a leading sports progressive. According to the Times, this could happen as soon as 2021 if the teams agree, with talks already underway. One source tells the paper a “significant” number of concessions will be required. “Formula One wants to showcase as much as possible that sport is diverse,” runs another quote. “It doesn’t want to go there and disappear again with no impact.” Well. There will certainly be an impact if F1 holds a race in a country where women were allowed to drive only last year, and where, up until last week, they were not permitted to travel without formal permission from a male member of their family, to say nothing of the imprisonments without trial, mass public beheadings and so on that characterise life in the kingdom. Or indeed of the devastating intervention in Yemen which has caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. But it feels a shade more likely that such an impact would be in the arena of reputation laundering as far as Saudi Arabia is concerned and not in the field of diversity, or human rights, or any of the other things we are obliged to pretend a Formula One race might gift to a high-paying country. The idea that big-money sport heralds social change has been so comprehensively debunked by the evidence of recent mega-events from Russia to China to Qatar to Azerbaijan that it feels amazing its proponents have yet to come up with some other fig leaf for their money grabbing. Still, Liberty is on safer ground with its apparent insistence that any race in Saudi would have to happen under strict conditions. Guys, pretty much everything that happens in the kingdom happens under strict conditions. That’s kind of their thing, so this feels like an easy win for you. I mean, right off the bat I think we can be confident no unsolicited bikini-clad ladies will be besmirching the good name of Formula One if they race in Saudi, as Formula E already does. Clearly, bikinis are at odds with the “societal norms” of Saudi Arabia. Critical local press is also unlikely to be a problem – in short, there isn’t any. And internationally there was of course the matter of the murder and dismemberment of the dissident Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi embassy in Istanbul less than a year ago. But I’m sure we know what Formula One’s most idealistic minds are thinking: can’t a brutal dictatorial regime grow? Can’t a brutal dictatorial regime change? This is a question we are constantly being asked to consider as far as the crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, is concerned, given he has put a good nine-and-three-quarter months of clear blue water between now and the whole murder-and-dismemberment business, which he was concluded by the CIA to have personally ordered. I'm sure F1's most idealistic minds are thinking: can't a brutal dictatorial regime grow? Can't it change? As for the shifting “brand values” of Formula One, this isn’t the first time the prospect of a Saudi race has been raised. Naturally, it was originally a scheme of the former F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, as you’d have expected of a man whose managerial crushes included Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein. Bernie did manage to get the Bahrain Grand Prix up and running, reluctantly suspending it only once when the state was in the middle of a brutal crackdown against Arab Spring protesters. That the Saudi proposal would be resurrected under the Liberty regime felt less predictable but perhaps it has been playing the long game. To mark the end of the driving ban last year, a Saudi woman, Aseel al-Hamad, drove a lap of the Le Castellet circuit before the French Grand Prix. “I believe today is not just celebrating the new era of women starting to drive,” she told reporters, “it’s also the birth of women in motorsport in Saudi Arabia.” Maybe and yet maybe not. For all the guff talked about the healing power of Formula One, the chief beneficiaries of a Saudi Grand Prix would obviously be the Saudi regime and Formula One’s coffers. And, at another level, governments such as our own. These things always suit the British governments of the day, who really prefer people’s attention diverted to a scandal other than their continued insistence on selling arms to Saudi Arabia, despite knowing exactly what they are used for. It’s a useful distraction. Yes, as the Bahrain rows have shown, a lot of politicians will be much happier fielding questions over whether British drivers should boycott a potential Saudi race than questions over why their administration continues to enable arguably the most gruesome regime on earth. All told the Saudi Grand Prix feels quite the inevitability in the not-to-distant future, when it will be absolutely in line with the “brand values” of the UK to concede the foreign policy brief to Lewis Hamilton."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/06/mercedes-lewis-hamilton-red-bull-valtteri-bottas-carlos-sainz,"Lewis Hamilton’s win in Hungary after an unexpected change of tyres increased pressure on Valtteri Bottas while Carlos Sainz showed Red Bull what they’re missing Giles Richards Tue 6 Aug 2019 10.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 6 Aug 2019 10.12 BST Hamilton’s drive to victory was superb but it was the Mercedes decision to opt for a second stop that really stood out. After they gambled on fresh tyres there was no real opportunity for Red Bull to react; their only hope lay in Max Verstappen making his rubber last and, valiant as his effort was, just trying to stay ahead pushed them over the edge. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described Hamilton’s driving as in “another dimension” but notably paid homage to his team’s strategists. With just over 20 laps remaining they might have settled for the safe option of a guaranteed second place with, perhaps, Hamilton able to challenge Verstappen at the death on the tyres he was happy with. However, strategist James Vowles and his team decided to take the chance of new rubber and a charge. This was bold, impressive and proof the team have not lost any ambition despite their dominance this season. After fifth place at a wet Hockenheim Carlos Sainz made it two in a row with fifth in Hungary, cementing his place as the best of the midfield drivers. Having had two retirements in the opening races Sainz has since returned a points tally that McLaren might have expected from Fernando Alonso. He is seventh in the world championship, five points behind Red Bull’s Pierre Gasly. Sainz’s drive at the Hungaroring exemplified why he is standing out. Once up to fifth he was inch-perfect, smooth and metronomic in getting the very best out of the McLaren as the team reinforced their position in fourth. Gasly, the driver Red Bull chose over Sainz last year, was woeful, lapped by Verstappen in the same machinery and crucially unable to play any part in Red Bull’s race at the front. The team principal, Christian Horner, pointedly noted: “The problem is he’s not in the mix at all”. Red Bull still believe they can beat Ferrari in the constructors’ championship but as things stand Gasly is their achilles heel. What also became clear from Hamilton’s charge was just how strong the Mercedes still is. Verstappen was adamant that the rate at which the British driver caught him proved just how much more they could get out of their engine when required. “I think you can see how much margin they still have when they really need to push,” he said. Which makes it one of the most sought-after rides and Valtteri Bottas knows his days may be numbered. After a strong start to the season with two wins he has faltered. He scored 120 points in his first six races but has only 68 from last six. In Hungary Wolff said the team would chose between Bottas and their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon. Ocon, who has come through the Mercedes junior system, is highly rated by the team and they are keen he should be in F1. On form, opting for young blood would seem the likely option but Hamilton is very comfortable having Bottas alongside him and his feelings doubtless carry huge weight. The decision will be made over the summer break. Hungary heralds the beginning of F1’s summer break and what a way to go out. After some at best listless meetings the last four have been close to unmissable. Beginning with Austria, where Verstappen’s bravura recovery from ninth to the win stole the show; through the British Grand Prix where passing and incident abounded, to the drama of Germany in changing conditions. Then Hungary; once derided for serving up soulless processions the circuit has come into its own of late and rarely delivers anything but a sterling show. This year was no exception. There is no single defining factor why these four have made for such spectacles but what cannot be ignored is that the layouts themselves played a role, which is a lesson for F1 to learn. With the calendar next season set to be 22 meetings, which is as many as it seems every team are willing to tolerate, any proposed additions that may replace circuits recognised for good racing ought to be fit for purpose as well as financially inviting. George Russell was rightly elated with his performance at the Hungaroring, after coming within half a tenth of putting his car into Q2 before finishing the race in 16th. This is far from where Williams want to be but the meeting gave a definitive indication they are moving forward. The team have cleared their manufacturing backlog and brought their first aero upgrade to Germany. In dry running in Hungary it was given a real assessment and passed. What they saw on track correlates with what had been expected in the wind tunnel and their pursuit of more downforce can now begin in earnest. Russell’s qualifying lap was exceptionally good and a stark reminder of his talent, while in the race he had the pleasure of mixing it up for once, passing Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat at turn four and five on lap one. Now Williams are in a position to be able bring on their car, there may yet be more small victories to come."
https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/27/why-stella-tennant-wants-you-to-stop-buying-new-clothes,"The model explains why she is joining forces with Oxfam for Second Hand September – a campaign that aims to reduce the environmental impact of fast fashion Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.57 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.00 BST This might sound strange, but if you were to take all the water you would be able to drink in the next 13 years, you would have the amount that it takes to make one T-shirt and a pair of jeans. Yet how many pairs of jeans and how many T-shirts must the average person own? For most, the total number is likely in double figures, which is to say: it will have taken a lot of H2O. It is facts like these – and the environmental damage they tell of – that are driving Second Hand September, a campaign established by Oxfam and supported by Stella Tennant, who has done a shoot with her 14-year-old daughter Iris to promote it. The premise: for the month of September the charity is asking people not to buy new clothes and instead to buy secondhand, from charity shops. With September for some a month of heightened consumption, it might not be the easiest ask. As the heat turns to cool, it can be a time to think about a new coat, to ponder the new-season woollen offering and whether you ought to invest in a new pair of boots. But new clothes come with a cost about which we can no longer claim ignorance – there is no avoiding the ways in which the fashion industry threatens the planet. Especially this month, as Extinction Rebellion gears up to disrupt the source of so many trends with protests planned for London fashion week. For Tennant, who first appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1993 and has stalked down catwalks for Chanel and Jean Paul Gautier during her career: “It’s going to take us a long time to change our habits, but I think that this is so obviously a step in the right direction,” she says over the phone from what sounds like a breezy Scotland. For her, the next generation – her daughter’s, for instance – will be able to change their shopping habits more easily. Iris already visits charity shops and it can’t hurt that she has a secondhand treasure trove that most other teens couldn’t even dream of, thanks to her mum. “It looks different on them when they’re wearing clothes I’ve had since the 90s,” says Tennant. “I’m so pleased I kept them and they’re having a second outing.” The shopping habits of the older generation are, for Tennant, perhaps a little less trend-driven – she only buys about five new items a year, she says. “At my age I think it’s probably quite normal you’re not that interested in consuming, [and not] loving shopping as much as when you’re much younger.” Although, she concedes, “we all need to think a little bit harder”. This is why she rates the idea of Second Hand September. “In that month, you might just think a bit differently about how you would normally shop … [it is] a period of time to consider what you’re buying and what you’re consuming and why: what do you really want; what do you really need?” The shoot, styled by thrift-aficionado and Vogue contributor Bay Garnett and shot by Tom Craig, is proof that secondhand doesn’t have to mean stained armpits and moth-eaten togs. Look particularly to the turquoise and black stripey shirt and men’s trousers that Tennant wears in one shot – her favourite from the shoot – for evidence that a move away from new threads doesn’t have to mean a move towards bad style. For Tennant, it’s “a total no-brainer”. And this campaign is “taking away any stigma [around secondhand], and saying: actually this is a really great way to shop … [plus it] benefits the charities while you’re doing it.” The charity shops near where she lives are great on cashmere jumpers, while her favourite secondhand garment is an emerald green Yves Saint Laurent shirt from the 70s that she bought in a vintage shop on holiday. In case you still need convincing, here are a few more facts: each week in the UK, 11 million items of clothing are sent to landfill, and every year the clothes sent to landfill weigh as much as the Empire State Building. Proof, if any more were needed that we need to curb our shopping habits. With Second Hand September, Oxfam is hoping to make a dent. There is already something of a silver lining: the clothes that Oxfam saves from landfill every year weigh as much as the Eiffel Tower. For Tennant, it is a fun challenge for people to take on. Of course, as she puts it, “the fashion industry really is all about creating a desire that you didn’t even know you had”. This is about trying to counter that desire, or, at the very least, look to secondhand instead.

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.30 BST Name: Status toilets. Age: Popping up all the time. Appearance: Shiny and new. Great. I love a good toilet. Who doesn’t? Just don’t love them too much. Is that possible? Sadly, it is. And now the status toilet has begun to creep into modern homes. Is this one of those musical, self-opening ones from Japan that spray you in the fundament for an encore? Sometimes it might be. Although the status toilet is more about quantity than quality. I would struggle to use more than one toilet at a time, to be honest. Well, quite. But according to a report in the Sunday Times, 82% of two-bedroom homes sold by Hamptons International last year have at least two bathrooms, while more than a third of four-bed homes have at least four. Talk about being spoiled for choice! Indeed – and many new homes in the US are being built with more toilets than residents. That seems … odd. It seems odd to Kevin McCloud of Grand Designs, too. “Bathrooms are extremely wasteful in terms of resource, yet people are putting more in their homes than there are actual occupants,” he said. “Four people live in the house and put in six toilets. I don’t understand that.” Maybe if you’re rich it is important to have your own personal toilet, plus a few spares. Maybe. Perhaps you need to have a choice, so you can think to yourself: “This feels like an east wing poo kind of day.” It is important to follow your feelings in these matters. The Weidlake complex of four rented party houses in Hollywood has 32 bedrooms and 51 bathrooms, but still receives complaints of “public urination”. I guess it just feels right sometimes. I guess, but Buckingham Palace has 78 toilets, just to be on the safe side. Although, er, paying visitors can’t use any of them. Spoilsports! Surely that would be the main attraction. I know. It is hard for private citizens to experience that kind of luxury. Olga Kogan, the wife of the Russian oligarch Valery Kogan, once hoped to build a mansion in Connecticut with 26 bathrooms, but had to scale down her plans to a mere 15. Eleven toilets gone for ever! How their oligarch pals must sneer at them. It’s very sad, I know. Do say: “Can you tell me which door is the toilet, please?” Don’t say: “Maybe it’s easier if you just tell me which ones aren’t toilets.”"

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 22.05 BST As the freshly plundered FedEx truck disappears down the lane, not so much as a bronze centime left rattling around the back, now seems as good a time as any to take stock of the year in golf. So here are our (slightly less valuable) end-of-season prizes. Anticlimax of the year The first big event of the season was The Match: Tiger v Phil. Yes, we’d forgotten about it, too. The sudden-death denouement to this much-trumpeted mano-a-mano atmosphere-free farce saw two detached zillionaires playing a 93-yard par-three over and over as the darkness fell. They’re planning another one, cleats wearily trudging on a human face for ever. Heartbreak of the year In 2012, Kim In-kyung missed a one-foot putt for the Dinah Shore. A choke of Doug Sandersesque magnitude. This year she had a chance to slay the demon, in the mix on Sunday at the ANA Inspiration (the tournament’s current guise). But her hopes were dashed in surreal fashion as her ball hit a branch, snagged in a knot of twigs, and stubbornly refused to drop. Thank goodness she’s got a British Open on her CV, or this narrative would be too much to bear. Quadruple bogey of the year Rory “MacGuffin” McIlroy on the 1st at Portrush. And there was us thinking five over after six at Birkdale was a shaky start. As his opening drive snap-hooked out of bounds, taking a nation’s hopes with it, Shane Lowry was on 9 making birdie, the real plot unfolding in plain sight. Nonuple bogey of the year Portrush again, where former Open champ turned weekend hacker David “Hold My Beer, Ian Baker-Finch” Duval took 14 on the 7th, after losing two tee shots then playing the wrong ball. He also carded two triples and a quadruple on his way to a 36-hole score of +27. Just for the record, he played the back nine on Friday in one under. Of course he did. Player of the year Ko Jin-young. Two majors and one near miss, and with a swing so smooth she makes Freddie Couples look like Jim Furyk. The Rodney Dangerfield award for getting no respect Brooks Koepka uses perceived slights as fuel, so the Bethpage Black crowd chanting for Dustin Johnson as the pair tussled for the PGA was only asking for trouble. Koepka looked like shipping his six-shot lead in embarrassing fashion, before deciding he simply wasn’t having it. “OK. All right. I’ve got everybody against me. Let’s go.” He regrouped, retained the Wanamaker Trophy, and his current run in the majors is 1-2-1-2-4. So there’s plenty of admiration for him round our way, and that’s before we get to his righteous campaign against the evil of slow play. “Some of these guys are so slow, I’ll take my sweet time getting to the ball. I don’t have to go to the bathroom, but I go and chill in there for five minutes, so we get on the clock. And now we’re playing at my pace.” You have got to love this guy. Shot of the year On the final day at the ANA, Xiyu Lin shoved her approach into 18 way right. She ended up on the walkway crossing Poppie’s Pond, her route to the flag blocked by a wall and a large decorative ceramic pot. No problem! In lieu of going direct, she bumped her ball along the bridge, pinged it off a bank so it took a sharp left turn, and sent it trickling to kick-in distance. Par! That’s the thing with the pros; they’d spank us at crazy golf as well. Augusta National performance of the year Hats off to Tiger, of course, but did he secure victory by playing the last six holes in five under with a migraine? Jennifer Kupcho was two behind Maria Fassi on the 13th tee during the final round of the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur. Despite a Withnailesque bastard behind the eyes, she finished eagle, par, birdie, birdie, par, birdie, blitzing the field with a 67. Three months later, she made three birdies in the last four at the Evian, her pin-seeking final-day 66 snatching second place from nowhere, in only her third major as a pro. Her easy-going style suggests she might end up making a habit of this. Fairytale debut of the year Hinako Shibuno, the Smiling Cinderella, turned up at Woburn for her first tournament outside Japan, the British Open, assuming the course would be a seaside links, just like the men’s. You could argue that her manager should have been all over this, but it seems he was too busy sourcing the cuddly toy duck he would wave all week from behind the ropes while sporting a neon-blue curly wig. Whether Shibuno took things any more seriously is a moot point, as she spent all four days winning over the gallery with her infectious spirit and superstar charm. Oh, and she drove it long and straight, peppered the flags with heat-seeking irons, and struck a carpe-diem winning putt that would still be rolling today had it not met the hole flush. She didn’t hang about, either. Brooks would doubtless approve. Remaining hope for the year Here’s wishing Europe all the best in the Solheim Cup. Though after what happened on the 18th at Woburn, you’d need a hard heart to deny Lizette Salas, five feet from glory, a repeat of her winning-putt heroism of 2017. It’s on!"
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/27/rugby-union-players-mental-illness-rfu,"A toxic culture of denial pervades rugby, but the sport must be more honest with itself about players’ mental wellbeing Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.47 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.40 BST The interview with Kearnan Myall last week prompted an extraordinary reaction. The former Wasps forward’s searing account of being driven to the verge of taking his own life, in part because of the unseen pressures as a professional rugby player, attracted sympathy from around the world and prompted messages from significant quarters both inside and outside the game. Those who took the trouble to show their public support for Myall included current members of England’s World Cup squad, World Rugby officials, the International Rugby Players’ Association, former World Cup winners, numerous ex-internationals both from England and elsewhere and many current players, some from other sports. There were also heartfelt messages from hundreds of people with experience of depression who felt intensely grateful to Myall for telling his story. The rising incidence of mental illness in sport, as Damian Hopley of the Rugby Players’ Association stressed in the Guardian last week, is not going away. It is vital sporting bodies do not simply pay lip service to the issue when it makes the headlines. The aim has to be to redouble their efforts to help those in need or, even better, stop them suffering in the first place. Myall’s testimony would suggest there remains a long way to go. Because the seeds of self-doubt can be sown very young. A highly respected former international head coach phoned the other day and passed on the story of a recent age‑group trial in the north of England. On arrival the kids were told half would be heading home within the hour if they could not meet certain basic physical and fitness criteria. Their ability with a ball was entirely secondary. What does such crass thinking do to youthful self‑esteem and self‑image, particularly for young tight forwards? Then there are the academies themselves. Myall says he was taught how to be a rugby player but not, necessarily, how to do deal with problems beyond the touchline. Clearly improvements have been made in the past four or five years but not everyone is putting the player’s interests first. At least one leading club academy is telling would-be hopefuls to attend a specific local college if they want to progress. As a result some youngsters are choosing to abandon their A-level studies for less rigorous qualifications, despite having little realistic prospect of a glittering pro rugby career. The university pathway is theoretically a better bet, given rugby is seen as a “late maturation” sport. Some disturbing tales, however, continue to emerge. The Guardian has already been told of at least one prominent sport-obsessed university where preseason initiations for new arrivals – including being forced to strip naked and complete demeaning exercises for the amusement of others – prompted disquiet among first-year students and parents last week. Some university clubs are inviting wannabe players along for preseason training, only to send them packing again if their grades fall below expectations. Little thought is given to those forced to pack their bags, their high hopes dashed. Someone else can deal with that. Which leads us back to the Rugby Football Union, whose age-group coaching structure is in tatters following the rat‑a‑tat departures of Dean Ryan, Steve Bates and, now, Jim Mallinder. That highly experienced trio had not long replaced the well-regarded John Fletcher and Peter Walton at the helm of England’s junior sides. Now, on the eve of a new season with many of the best candidates committed elsewhere, the RFU is again recruiting coaches for its under-18 and under-20 age groups. This may seem a minor issue with a senior World Cup about to start; it is anything but. What on earth has happened to the RFU conveyor belt that is supposed to be all about delivering success in 2023 and 2027? Even the most promising talents now face an anxious wait to see if their face fits with the next regime. Who, exactly, beyond their clubs (where they may struggle for Premiership game-time) is looking out for them? If you then factor in the game’s increasing physical demands, the concussion dangers, the sink‑or‑swim professional environment and the everyday doubts experienced by each young person, you have a potentially dangerous cocktail – even for those perceived to have “made it”. It does not require a post-graduate degree in psychiatry from Oxford to suggest rugby, which does not yet boast life-changing salaries for all, is not the healthiest profession for those with limited other outlets in life. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Myall’s experience has highlighted another vital issue. Part of the reason his story has resonated so far and wide is down to his honesty, an increasingly elusive quality in professional sport. Unions and clubs much prefer players to be heard via their own carefully filtered channels, not pouring their hearts out in the Guardian. The Irish Rugby Football Union set an unwelcome precedent last week by declining to make any coaches or players available to London-based media at Twickenham on the day before the game, as is customary. An IRFU spokesman even told me last season that “we don’t need the British papers”, seemingly forgetting that several of his squad hail from Northern Ireland. Their RFU counterparts, meanwhile, have started talking in a strange code, employing empty euphemisms such as “muscle soreness” when asked for regulation injury updates. It contributes further to a toxic culture of denial, evasion and suppression, which inevitably percolates downwards. If rugby is serious about creating a healthier environment for its participants it needs to start being more honest with itself. South Africa have just confirmed their World Cup squad with Wales and Scotland due to confirm their selections in the coming days. Spare a thought for those who, for assorted reasons, are already resigned to sitting out the game’s showpiece tournament. It is already possible to put together a fine ‘missing’ XV, which does not even include Morgan Parra, Teddy Thomas, Danny Cipriani, Mike Brown et al: Damian McKenzie; Santiago Cordero, Israel Folau, Ben Te’o, Aphiwe Dyantyi; Gareth Anscombe, Rhys Webb; Census Johnston, Dylan Hartley, Uini Atonio, Will Skelton, Brad Shields, Facundo Isa, Dan Leavy, Taulupe Faletau. Any or all of them could have enjoyed a prominent tournament in Japan. Finally it is happening. One of the home unions, Scotland, is heading for Tbilisi to play Georgia in a capped senior rugby international, albeit a World Cup warm-up fixture. Whether or not the Scots travel home victorious, having just had the benefit of successive Tests against France, at least spectators in the Dinamo Arena will get to see them. To borrow from the former England captain John Pullin, whose team defied death threats to play in Ireland in the 1970s: “We may not be much good but at least we turn up.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 16.15 BST A brutish leader hands his crown to his benevolent brother in a land where everyone is welcome and loved. Has Shakespeare’s Forest of Arden ever felt quite so fantastical or indeed so desirable? Here’s a tonic for the soul in these fraught political times. This musical adaptation of As You Like It is the second show in the National Theatre’s Public Acts scheme, created in partnership with Queen’s theatre, Hornchurch and eight community organisations. The final production features over 100 community members and is truly inspiring; the kind of theatre that allows you to imagine a better, kinder and more inclusive future. The musical is almost entirely sung through, which is a relief since the script – adapted by Shaina Taub and Laurie Woolery – is a little wooden. But Taub’s songs and lyrics are quite brilliant. She has found a way to have fun with Shakespeare while absolutely nailing his big ideas and subtler moments of reflection. There’s an ingenious melodic mashup of the Seven Ages of Man speech from an enjoyably grumpy Jacques (Beth Hinton-Lever) who stomps about the stage, muttering darkly to anyone who’ll listen. Orlando’s earnest love poems, scratched out on to the trees of Arden, are transformed into exquisitely cheesy pop numbers (“My love for you is like a hamburger – rare but well done.”); and Rosalind’s songs are the very best of the lot. There’s more than a touch of #MeToo to her empowering ballads, performed with elegance and guts by Ebony Jonelle. The big chorus numbers are a thrill and it’s just a shame that Douglas Rintoul’s production, hampered by a relatively small stage, doesn’t include more of them. Hayley Grindle reimagines the Forest of Arden as an explosion of colourful crepe paper and slinky curtains of rainbow ribbons. Rohan Reckord, as the exiled Duke Senior, leads his singers in a warm calypso number, relaxed and full of hope. As our lovers come to the end of their story, the community gathers together once more. They sing of their fears for the future and then, in one booming voice, shout out: “Still I will love.” The audience stands and cheers. • At Queen’s theatre, Hornchurch, until 27 August."

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.30 BST Naomi Osaka overcame intense nerves and a stuttering start to open her US Open title defence with a 6-4 6-7 (5) 6-2 win over Russia’s Anna Blinkova and reach the second round in New York. The world No 1 returned to the scene of her first grand slam title preoccupied by a knee injury after she was forced to retire from her quarter-final match in Cincinnati. After limping off the court on 16 August she was resolute: “In the end, I’m going to play even if the doctor says no.” The 21 year-old played with a support on her left knee but her movement looked comfortable throughout. It was her ground strokes that were the problem as she struggled to find consistency. “I don’t think I’ve ever been this nervous in my life,” Osaka said. “She played really amazing and for me I just came off really slow. For me, I don’t think I found my rhythm but I fought as hard as I could.” Osaka reeled off five successive games to take the first set 6-4 but after grabbing hold of the match the world No 1 lost the tie-break in the second. Early in the final set, Osaka was forced to save three break points. “There were moments where I played really well, and then moments where I didn’t play as well,” she said. “I think as a whole, I just need to learn how to stay more consistent on the good side.” The two-time grand slam champion’s victory at the Australian Open in January completed her ascension to the number one ranking, but much of her year has seen her learn to deal with the attention and pressure of being the best. Against Blinkova, she resolved to stand up to the pressure. “I remember two years ago I played Kerber here,” said Osaka. “She was the defending champion. And I could see how stressed out she was when I was playing her. I don’t want to give people that look.“ Elsewhere, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep scuppered lucky loser Nicole Gibbs, while 19 year-old Canadian sensation Bianca Andreescu, who captured the Rogers Cup title at home in Toronto earlier this month, eased past 17 year-old Katie Volynets 6-2 6-4. Sixth seed Petra Kvitova, who has been troubled by a forearm injury since withdrawing from the French Open, moved on with a 6-2 6-4 win against qualifier Denisa Allertova."
https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/22/telling-lies-review-endless-possibilities-in-brilliant-detective-story,"While untangling a web of lies players are tantalisingly close to the characters in this believable world created by Sam BarlowPC; Mac; iOS Alysia Judge Thu 22 Aug 2019 08.00 BST


Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 02.04 BST Suspense, plot and character have long been considered the foundations of a good thriller – but really, the sign of a mystery done well is a sound. It’s the “hwwwwahhh!” of air whooshing past your lips and down into your lungs after a pivotal reveal. It’s a noise certain to be heard during the hours spent untangling the secret at the heart of Telling Lies. Sam Barlow’s critically acclaimed Her Story (2015) introduced us to the concept of the interactive search engine thriller. In that game, you play an unnamed character who, for reasons unknown, is sitting at a computer trawling through hours of stolen police station video footage showing a suspect being interviewed. Your main investigation tool is a search bar where you type in keywords such as “love” to pull up tagged clips. One of those clips might include another clue, such as a name, which in turn can be searched to pull you further down the rabbit hole. By making notes and playing detective, it’s your job to decide what the truth is. Telling Lies follows four people working in very different jobs when a lie brings them all together. Whereas Her Story had one character in a police interview room, Telling Lies has multiple locations with a large supporting cast over two in-game years. Her Story’s static police camcorder is swapped for webcams, mobile phones and even a hidden camera in a belt buckle. The effect is like the moment Dorothy steps from her monochrome farmhouse into Oz – everything opens up. No longer hearing about events in the past tense, this time you witness key moments as they happen. From a violent rally to a seductive webcam session, you’re tantalisingly close to the characters’ lives. This intimate access not only builds a believable world, it deepens the mystery where a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it glimpse of a name badge becomes a vital clue to progress. It’s a testimony to the set designers and Barlow’s fastidious writing that each clip is bursting with possibilities that could be the key to unlocking a lie. Conversely, it’s also troublingly easy to lose hours chasing a red herring. This seemingly unending web of possibilities makes Telling Lies a brilliant detective story. Each clip is a one-sided conversation, which creates a fascinating puzzle where part of the challenge is guessing the right keyword to assemble the other half of the dialogue. “Who are they talking to?” is a common question in the opening few hours, but given enough time with the characters you’ll be able to work out who they’re speaking to in a new clip simply by their tone of voice. The computer you’re working off is a stolen NSA database of recorded clips, some of which run for eight minutes. This leads to some frustration when a keyword drops you into the video at the five minute mark, and you have to rewind the clip back to the beginning like it’s an analogue cassette rather than a digital media player – thus wasting valuable time. An upside to this is you end up paying more attention to details whizzing past in the background, or a tiny eyebrow raise you’d otherwise have missed. These small facial inflections are brought to life via stellar performances that never lose believability. Logan Marshall-Green (Prometheus) anchors the plot with ease and assurance, while Kerry Bishé (Scrubs) is convincing as his increasingly impatient wife. An unexpected joy is Vivien Lyra Blair (Bird Box), who plays their young daughter with adorable confidence. Marshall-Green’s bedtime stories to her via video call provide some of the tender moments of the game. Telling Lies is an excellent expansion on the work Barlow did in Her Story to resurrect the full motion video (FMV) genre. Despite the Hollywood pedigree of its cast, this is a game in a way that an “interactive movie” can’t be. There’s too much to explore, too much to untangle, and even a working copy of Solitaire to play when your brain is fried by the latest plot twist. Telling Lies requires a deliberateness from its players that turns us from viewers to active plot participants. It’s a game that doesn’t hold your hand, and ultimately it’s down to you to decide the truth – another secret of a good mystery done well."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 09.41 BST Ah, ’Darkers. Here ’twas. The end of an era. And so ’tis only right that there be many fireworks. “I may have used a little too much powder,” grinned Zacky. “Proper job!” And so ended our life in Nampara. Not so much with a bang or a whimper but with a series of bangs that left us with a bit of a headache. (I wish. Let’s not dwell on that metaphor.) What a great deal of powder indeed was used for this episode! Was it too much powder? Or simply what was needed for a proper job? It’s hard to say. But I think a fair assessment is that there was enough going on here to last us another few years of Poldark, so it was kind of annoying that it had to end this way, wrapped up so abruptly, almost with the action on fast-forward to get through it all in time. In the end it was pretty great television. There was just too much of everything. “The agony of never just a moment’s peace! It’s my faith that’s broken. It can’t be remade.” Well, we know how you feel Demelza. The first 27 minutes of this were agony, us not entirely knowing whether Ross had gone bad or whether he was just doing his James Bond act. It became extremely confusing knowing who was on what side and extremely stressful worrying about whether Sir Evil George and the slave traders would foil everything. If the “Ross as double agent” storyline had one flaw, it was that they couldn’t decide whether to let the viewers in on the secret or not. They wanted it both ways. They wanted us to know that he wasn’t really cheating on Demelza and that it was all for the mission. But they also wanted us to think, “Has he really gone over to the dark side?” This is an incredibly ambitious effect to try to pull off and it didn’t quite work. There were times when as a viewer you just didn’t know whether you were coming or going. We were told at the beginning that this was all “five months later”, which was supposed to explain Ross’s personality transplant. “Your wife asks no questions?” “My wife knows her place.” Er, hello, have you met Demelza? And what on earth is this liaison with Tess? And the business about being a humble country squire? But of course it was all a ruse. “You ’ad all them Frenchies fooled and me besides.” Aside from this slightly messy masquerade, there were many exciting moments, some supremely joyous, some unbearably sad. We got to see some great scenes between Ross and Demelza, even if they were weighted with falsehood (because he was keeping his spying secret). “How needful would you say is honesty betwixt husband and wife?” Oh dear. We’ve been here before. We had poor, broken Demelza: “When did I lose you, Ross? When I look at your face, I see a stranger.” And then we had triumphant, wily Demelza: “I should like to see him humiliated before his dispatch.” How did her mind leap to such a plan! Because she is most excellent, that is why! It was irritating, of course, that so many people got caught in the crossfire of Ross’s patriotically well-intentioned lies. If it wasn’t bad enough that Demelza and Ross were at each other’s throats then here were Dr Enys and Sindy Doll doing the same thing. And Dr Enys was supposed to have been holding a candle for Kitty? Added to that the sadness of Sindy Doll holding the girl baby! Unbearable! (Morwenna’s baby!) But how very joyous to see their reconciliation and the opening of Caroline’s heart. “Without such opening, are we yet but half a life?” And finally we came to the weird reconciliation of Ross and Sir Evil George. It’s never a good thing when Sir Evil George gets his hands on one, let alone two, pistols. But for once it worked out. “Dispose of both bodies. Who would know?” He might make a revolutionary yet. I thought they could have gone farther emotionally in these scenes. “Might I suggest a brandy?” “No.” “Think I might poison you?” “I wouldn’t rule it out.” But we stayed close to reality and just as we thought Sir Evil George might asked Ross and Demelza to take in Valentine, he pulled back. Many thanks to all the ’Darkers who have followed this blog these many long years. And who have conjured up a below-the-line community that be joyfully affectionate and affectionately critical at same time. And congratulations to the writer, Debbie Horsfield, who created this great unwieldy anachronistic beast of a story for television and almost – almost – managed to tame it. I thought a flashback to Elizabeth was missing in this episode. And there definitely wasn’t enough Prudie. But still. “Where’s our faith? Where’s our gratitude?” It’s still here. “Two hearts. One beat. Can’t ask any more than that. There isn’t any more to ask.” Well, except for the utter destruction of Sir Evil George. But that, my friends, will have to wait for another day. This has to go to Demelza, of course. She had to go through approximately 197 emotional states in this episode from “woman scorned” and Mata Hari to Call the Midwife and Mr and Mrs. If it wasn’t enough that Demelza had survived (a) thinking that Ross was having it off with Tess (b) saving him by encouraging the nasty Frenchman to do the sword-fighting (c ) being a midwife two seconds later to Loveday Carne. (Silly name!) Obviously we can’t praise Aidan Turner enough for his portrayal of Ross (who is himself sometimes very silly indeed and not an easy role to imbue with verisimilitude). But without Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza, I don’t think this show would have resonated in the way it has. The two of them excel as a couple. But they are also both able to carry individual scenes with incredible poignancy and weight. Demelza had to do this doubly in this episode: having to act out an eventuality that the viewer knew to be untrue but still make it look true to us. That is virtually impossible. Except for Demelza, of course, for whom nothing is impossible. Not even making the same green coat look fresh every time she wears it, despite owning it for 11 years. “Some days I almost forget her face for two hours at a time.” Oh Geoffrey Charles, you are as soppy as your father. “I got bigger fish to fry than ’e now, preacher.” Sure you have, girl. Tess was given a bit more nuance in her character in this episode and she did well with it, even making us feel a bit sorry for her. Beware hubris, ’Darkers! It don’t lead to marriage to a hot preacher. “Do ’e not think ’e deserve as much joy? For who in this world have never gone astray?” Who indeed, Rosena? Ah, it would be a hard-hearted viewer who wouldn’t weep at this. “My only thought was to protect you.” “Ross, I’ve always been indebted to you.” “My debt to you can never be repaid. But for the rest of my life, I will try.” I’m not crying. You’re crying. Well, he’s coming back to bring in the corn so there’s always hope. Only we won’t be seeing it. Except for in our dreams, ’Darkers. “I swear to you, my love, I will return.” But you won’t, will you? Thanks a lot, BBC. THANKS A LOT. Thank heaven for DVD boxsets is all I can say. And the “pause” button. Not that I’m permanently freeze-framing the scything on 65-inch plasma screen or anything like that. No, no, don’t be ridiculous.

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 01.17 BST There is no good way to lose a match but some are better than others. Kyle Edmund can be proud that, unlike Stefanos Tsitsipas, he left the US Open with his dignity intact, fighting for every second of the four hours and 21 minutes it took Pablo Andújar to subdue him in five sets of the most honest endeavour. The same could not be said of the noisy exit of Tsitsipas, who was heard to say “You’re all weirdos” to Damien Dumusois after the respected French umpire had warned him about interjections from his box in the latter stages of his match against Andry Rublev. The determined young Russian won 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (7), 7-5 in three hours and 54 minutes, the longest match of his career. Out too, went the fourth seed and two-time French Open finalist, Dominic Thiem, almost quietly in two hours and 23 minutes as Thomas Fabbiano put together a workmanlike 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 result. The unseeded Italian did the same to Tsitsipas at Wimbledon, which ignited a surlier response than his reaction to defeat on Tuesday. “The umpire was very incorrect,” Tsitsipas said. “I don’t know what he has against my team but he was complaining about them all the time. I never heard anything from my team from outside the court or to make me play better.” It would seem to be open season on umpires, a regrettable development. Edmund, meanwhile, was a model of decorum. Perhaps he is still too nice.Maybe there is a case for him to find his inner Tsitsipas. Or not; he cannot deny his nature. Also, credit must go to 33-year-old Andujar for outlasting him in a 3-6, 7-6 (1), 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 win of several twists and turns. Edmund has struggled with a knee injury since the 2018 Paris Masters but insisted on his arrival in New York that it felt fabulous; that public declaration of health held up well enough, although there was a noticeable power outage at the very end. It was a match he would have expected to win, despite losing heavily to the Spaniard the only time they had met previously, in Marrakesh last year. They exchanged breaks here in a stuttering start, although Andujar, pinned deep by a heavy forehand, looked the more vulnerable. He has had his moments in a long career but three elbow surgeries and long absences have hindered his game, so they were trading physical frailties. The British No 1 could not cash in on three break points in the fourth game but still had his nose in front after half an hour and kept it there. He punished Andujar’s second serve to break again with a rocket of a forehand and served out the set in 40 minutes. All looked well. The second set was following the pattern of the first until Edmund, 3-1 and 4-2 up, lost focus as Andujar fought back to force a tie-break, where he duly pounced to level. Edmund’s box started to worry when he dropped a close third set but he came to life brilliantly at the end of the fourth, breaking Andujar to love with four exquisite winners across both wings and they were back on equal terms in a close, fascinating match. Edmund held and broke at the start of the fifth with a well-constructed backhand at the net to suggest he would finish the stronger of the two, but he handed the advantage back straight away. Andujar saved three break points in the fourth game, Edmund four in the 13-minute fifth – but not a fifth, as Andujar’s backhand teased the back line. After four-and-a-quarter hours Edmund’s fatigue kicked in hard and he was broken to love. Andujar went to match point with his seventh ace, Edmund’s legs leaving him rooted to the spot. Then his arms gave up on him as he framed the last shot of the match. Andujar will be tired, too. How much he has left for the second round on Thursday is unknown. He plays the 24-year-old Italian Lorenzo Sonego and, while the world No 49 has rarely lived up to his potential, he was too good for the experienced Spaniard, Marcel Granollers, winning 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Court 9 in two hours and 21 minutes. Elsewhere on that side of the draw, the 2014 champion, Marin Cilic gave fans on Court 5 value for money, beating the Slovak Martin Klizan 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (6). Alexander Zverev suffered for his win, though, taking five sets to see off the world No 41, Radu Albot, on Court 17."

Last modified on Sun 11 Aug 2019 16.52 BST Lewis Hamilton feels at the peak of his powers and has no intention of retiring soon. Having completed the most successful first half of a Formula One season in his career with a thrilling victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the five-times world champion is firmly on track to take another title this year. Hamilton beat Red Bull’s Max Verstappen into second place at the Hungaroring after completing a brilliantly executed race. With Mercedes taking a gamble on stopping twice, Hamilton closed down a 20-second gap to Verstappen and passed him with three laps to go. The charge was a display of ruthless, precision driving by Hamilton and secured his eighth win from 12 grands prix. “I want the second half to be even stronger than this first half,” Hamilton said. “I am 34 years old but I feel like I am driving better than ever. Hopefully on Sunday you could see I have not lost any speed.” Hamilton is in his 13th season in Formula One and has one more year on his contract with Mercedes, whom he joined in 2013 and with whom he has won four of his titles. He is two behind Michael Schumacher’s record of seven and only 10 behind his tally of race wins. He has already surpassed the German to claim the most pole positions. He has regularly faced questions about his future but in Hungary he was unequivocal that he was in the form of his life and believed there was more to come. “One day I will have to stop but right now I feel fantastic, physically and mentally,” he said. “I don’t have any plans on stopping anytime soon – there is more to do, more to win, more to achieve together inside and outside the car. “It’s been a phenomenal journey. We had our first win in Hungary together in 2013 and we have gone from strength to strength. The majority of the people are still here from when I joined the team. This journey had been remarkable, now I am excited to see what more we could do together.” Mercedes’ strategy at the Hungaroring proved inspired and capped a strong comeback after they had performed poorly at the previous race in Germany. They have been dominant this season, winning 10 of the 12 grands prix before the summer break. Only Red Bull have denied them, with Verstappen taking victory in Austria and Germany. Hamilton leads the drivers’ championship by 62 points from his teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Verstappen seven points further back. When asked to rate his performances this season out of 10, he delivered a considered assessment of “8.9/8.8”. He said Mercedes are constantly striving for more and, ominously for their rivals, expected improvement when racing resumes at Spa on 1 September. “I don’t believe we are ever complacent, we always arrive with the same mentality,” he said. “We have had all this success but everyone continues to work just as hard. No one is better than the other, we all lift each other up. “These eight wins in the first half of the season is obviously exceptional. I look at those races and I think: ‘Eight out of 12, there are still some missing, how did we miss those ones? How were we not perfect those weekends?’ “We have to continue to arrive and deliver as we have but we are not perfect by far. We still have areas where we can continue to improve.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.24 BST If you find yourself lost in the catacomb-like basement of London’s Southbank Centre on a weekend, you’ll probably stumble across Gary Crosby holding court, addressing a circle of teenagers on everything from the history of reggae in the Caribbean diaspora to British jazz in the 1980s. On the sweltering Saturday I meet him, Crosby is running 20 young musicians through the waypoints of Jamaican jazz, from Haitian carnival rhythms to poet Louise Bennett-Coverley’s patois, via the Skatalites and Bob Marley. He paces around the room while the students eagerly tap away on their phones – not texting but taking notes. Then he launches into a dub-laden take on the Herbie Hancock standard Cantaloupe Island. There is a quietly commanding quality to Crosby, which is perhaps down to his four decades as a bassist. In the mid-1980s, he co-founded the Jazz Warriors, a group that showcased the early careers of seminal musicians such as saxophonist Courtney Pine and vibes player Orphy Robinson. In the 90s, Crosby led a renowned weekly jam session at Camden’s Jazz Cafe. Now 64, he has spent so long cradling his instrument that he has taken on its soothingly resonant qualities, exuding an easygoing charm. Last month, he became the first jazz recipient of the Queen’s Medal for Music, adding to his OBE and topping off what he calls “the best and the worst 18 months of my life”. Life has not always run smoothly for Crosby. Born to Windrush-generation parents, he grew up in a disaffected black community in London. “There was black power happening, there was talk of Babylon, and a lot of young black men had to be intimidating because inside they were terrified of what might happen if they let their guard down.” He had his own brush with the law at 15, when he was arrested on suspicion of carrying cannabis during a police raid at a Soho club and placed under virtual house arrest by his parents. He was not charged, but while stuck at home, he discovered jazz. “I remember one night when everyone was out and Ella Fitzgerald came on the TV,” he says. “Her voice sent this rush of feeling through me, and since then I’ve been hooked on pursuing that in jazz.” He took up the bass, and went on to ascend to a central position in the late-80s black jazz revival spearheaded by the likes of Pine. Yet it wasn’t until 1991 that Crosby gained a sense of purpose. “I [had been] in Jamaica, and one of my closest friends was smoking a huge spliff, blowing plumes of it into my face, and he kept asking me, ‘What you doing when you get back to England?’ I told him I had a gig at Ronnie Scott’s, but he kept asking the same question. I finally realised that I wasn’t doing anything – I was being selfish with my career and I needed to help the younger musicians.” Back in London, Crosby and his partner, Janine Irons, set up Tomorrow’s Warriors, to encourage a greater diversity of young musicians to enter jazz. In the 28 years since the free programme – now based at the Southbank Centre – started, they have mentored thousands of musicians. Alumni include the saxophonist and rapper Soweto Kinch, and many London jazz artists including Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia and the Mercury prize-nominated Cassie Kinoshi. The London jazz revival of the past few years, “feels special because there’s no arrogance about it. These kids just want to play,” he says. “I don’t give a shit about the ‘London jazz scene’ – I just want more musicians to be able to create a lasting career and leave something behind.” The question of a legacy has been on Crosby’s mind since he suffered a near-fatal stroke in January 2018. “For three days I was really in a bad way. Knowing everything can go in a flash has given me so much more drive to finish what I started.” That means lobbying for arts funding – something he feels is as essential as the NHS – as well as passing on the reins of Tomorrow’s Warriors to the next generation. “I haven’t been able to play much myself since the stroke,” he says. “So I need to think about my own music now, because I’ve put that aside for 30 years.” Crosby says it was a difficult decision to accept his Queen’s Medal. “I haven’t always been in favour of the royal family,” he says. “But I spoke to all of my friends about it and realised that I’m not accepting it for me. It’s for Tomorrow’s Warriors, and for anything to get more funds and to raise its profile I need to turn up and put on that suit.” That suit will be donned again this month when Crosby’s recently formed Nu Civilisation Orchestra, made up of Tomorrow’s Warriors alumni, headline a Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall. “This is the future of the music: creating an orchestra that can hopefully gain a residency and keep people employed for years to come,” he says. “We need to not get distracted with the political bullshit but trust in the music – that’s where the humanity lies.” • Prom 54: Duke Ellington’s Sacred Music is at Royal Albert Hall, London, on 29 August. • This article was amended on 27 August 2019.

Last modified on Thu 15 Aug 2019 13.13 BST Nearly 30 years ago, a famous soprano told me privately that Plácido Domingo was “a bit of a groper”. She herself had been the object of the tenor’s unwanted sexual attentions during a car journey, she told me. Unwanted but not, it seems, unwonted. In the world of opera, she added, Domingo’s habit was well-known and not unique. The soprano was a woman who could take care of herself. She told me about Domingo almost in passing and certainly not for quotation or because she thought the story should become public. It was private information. I have never written anything about it until now. But times have changed, and rightly so. Whether the opera world has changed with it is another question. This week, the Associated Press reported that eight singers and a dancer have said that Domingo sexually harassed them in various incidents since the 1980s. Some of the incidents took place while the women were working in opera houses where the singer was in management positions. That means in either Washington DC or Los Angeles or both, since Domingo, now aged 78, had long management associations with each, a continuing one in the case of the Los Angeles Opera. Thanks to the impact of the #MeToo movement and the fall of powerful and serial sexual predators such as the film producer Harvey Weinstein, allegations of this kind, like the ones I heard all those years ago, are no longer kept private. In Domingo’s case, this meant that some US opera houses and concert halls have been quick to terminate planned events in which Domingo was scheduled to perform. The Philadelphia Orchestra and San Francisco Opera are among the venues that have rescinded their plans. LA Opera has promised an independent investigation of the allegations. Others, though, have been more cautious. Domingo is still scheduled to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in September and October, before returning again in November. The Met has said it will await the LA Opera review before deciding whether to continue with the engagements. In Europe, the Salzburg festival, where Domingo is due to perform on 25 August, has had no such scruples. Domingo will perform as scheduled, it has announced. In the UK, Domingo has had a long association with the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. His next performances there are not due until June 2020, when he will be seven months shy of his 80th birthday. Even so, Covent Garden is now in the spotlight, too. So are several other European opera houses where he is due to appear over the next 12 months, including Zurich, Vienna, La Scala Milan, Madrid, Hamburg, Munich and Berlin. All of them need to recognise that these allegations have put them on the spot and that they need to put the rights of their employees not be harassed ahead of their loyalty towards a once great artist who is not above the law. You might think that every one of the houses where Domingo is currently scheduled to perform would at least put their commitments on hold, pending the LA inquiry. Not so. Most seem to be keeping quiet in the hope the storm will blow away. The Salzburg response suggests that they remain reluctant to treat the issue properly for fear of damaging the goose that still lays their golden eggs. “I have known Plácido Domingo for more than 25 years,” the festival’s president, Helga Rabl-Stadler, said in a statement. “In addition to his artistic competence, I was impressed from the very beginning by his appreciative treatment of all festival employees … Had the accusations against him been voiced inside the Festspielhaus in Salzburg, I am sure I would have heard of it … Artistic Director Markus Hinterhäuser, Executive Director Lukas Crepaz and I all agree that Plácido Domingo should perform as planned.” The opera houses are cautious, perhaps culpably and irresponsibly so in some cases, because, in the end, they are caught in a trap that is largely of their own making. Opera houses, especially the biggest ones, rely on stars. Few stars are more lustrous than Domingo. He is the most famous singer in the world. Audiences love him. Opera houses charge top prices for his performances. Sponsors, on whom most opera houses depend, love nothing more than a Domingo evening. The consequence has been that he has been indulged on purely artistic grounds to a degree that few other performers would ever seek – let alone be encouraged – to emulate. He was once, and for a glorious period, the most outstanding operatic artist of his era. His performances of Verdi’s Otello at Covent Garden in 1980, 1987 and 1990, each time under the baton of Carlos Kleiber, remain the supreme experiences of my own opera-going life. But, at his age, the voice, the artistry and certainly the stage presence are shadows of what they once were. For the past decade, Domingo has toured the world singing baritone roles rather than the tenor roles that he made his own for so long. Yet he is not a true baritone. He should have retired long ago. He is, however, Plácido Domingo, and for many, that has always been enough. But surely not any longer."

Leah Harper Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.27 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 16.55 BST This outfit is all Paul Smith. I originally wore it when I interviewed Tracey Emin on stage at the GQ Heroes weekend. I wanted to look the business: cool, effortless, but funky as well. I went into the Paul Smith store and that pink shirt with the red belt and those trousers was hanging on a hanger and I just said: “That’s the look!” Pink is the opposite of emasculating; I’m not shy to wear pink. I work with a company called Pin Drop Studio, where we read stories to adults, and they had an event at the Tate Liverpool during the Keith Haring exhibition. I thought: “Well, that outfit worked before; why not repeat it?” That’s where this photo was taken. Steve McQueen is my style icon. I look at pictures of him now and I think: I want to look like that. I also like Jean-Michel Basquiat’s look – the cardigans; the loose-fitting, bohemian clothes. I’m very envious of people who can look effortlessly stylish – it’s what I aspire to. When you look like you’ve made too much effort, I find it gives me a bit of a headache. My daily style is very casual; I love a cargo pant; I like to be comfortable. When I was younger, I wore a lot of clothes that I felt quite stiff in. I’ve moved away from wearing jeans; I get too hot in them. When I go out, I’m definitely a shirt man; I love a nice shirt and belt. As an actor, I’m always in clothes that I wouldn’t necessarily choose to wear myself. I played a character who was an alcoholic in a film called Tower Block [in 2012] and I was put in this leather coat, which was horrific; it fitted terribly. It wasn’t attractive on any level, but it was what that character would wear – I thought: “He’s in his own insular world, he’s got a habit and he’s completely caught up in that.” Playing new characters is exciting when it comes to the clothes: it’s about pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone."

But has the climate emergency put an end to that? Contact author Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 22.43 BST There is an apple in my imagination, a memory. I can still picture the first moment I saw it in the scorching dusk, the first fruit of a tree my partner and I had planted just two years before. The sapling had taken root in the loamy clay of our garden and grown upwards over two hot summers and two dry winters. Now, it was bearing fruit, not yet ripe, and rough to the touch, but an apple nonetheless. The first of many. We had planted the tree for the children we didn’t yet have, knowing it could come to bear fruit as they grew. It was an investment in our environment for the good of our children, an investment in their future, but we found that apple among the stones of the garden bed not long after. It had fallen, burned on the branch, scorched on one side. That squalid summer was the warmest on record and our city – Adelaide – had suffered the hottest day ever recorded in an Australian capital. The loss of our first fruit wasn’t too surprising given the placement of the tree, but agriculturalist modelling has found that the common Malus domestica will struggle to fruit in our state’s heating climate over the next 10 to 30 years. With eight of the top 10 warmest years occurring since 2005, farmers in South Australia have already started ripping up failing apple trees. We cut the scorched face from the fallen apple and ate what unripe flesh remained. We naturally invest in the environment for the good of our children, but that burned apple has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am haunted by a realisation: the apple tree we planted in our garden will have stopped fruiting by the time my children are my age, and we are investing in a future that is already breaking. We make so many decisions not just for ourselves now but for the future. We invest in a sense of place, in a community, perhaps in a house. We sow seeds both social and economic, knowing they will benefit our children more than us, but the climate emergency we face infringes all of it. The memory of our first apple tells me that the threat to my children is already here It isn’t just suburban apple trees we’ll lose. 70% of our cities’ trees will be vulnerable in a heating climate and many won’t survive the next 50 years. Nearly 70% of our population live in capital cities, most of which were built alongside seas that have already been warming and rising for decades. Modelling suggests that rising sea levels could see my own street flood during high tide in my older years. Apple trees, leafy streets and family homes are all rather middle-class concerns, but these simple things represent a crisis that, if unaddressed by 2030, will later result in drought, food scarcity and poverty. Some studies consider these projections to be optimistic and instead articulate a worse-case scenario that could see Australia face significant security risks by 2050. Children born this year will have been conceived in the midst of a mass extinction event, and will reach old age as the worst of the climate emergency hits. The projections are complex and catastrophic, meaning that the climate emergency often feels distant, and delayed. It forever feels like an apocalypse deferred, triggering denialism, but the scientific consensus tells us that the threat to our immediate environment, and society at large, will be existential. The memory of our first apple tells me that the threat to my children is already here. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Everything is adrift. Markets have no conscience. Our prime minister smugly brandishes totems of coal in parliament and emissions have trended upwards for the past five years of conservative government. We are leaderless, and every personal response we imagine can seem all too powerless – fruitless even. School children will take to the streets in frustration again next month to protest this absence of leadership. I grieve for them, for any to come into the world now, but seeing the School Strike 4 Climate movement prompts me to hope in them also, to rethink what it is we are planting and sowing and to recentre all of it. We invest in our environment for the good of our children, but perhaps we should be investing in our children for the good of the environment instead. The climate emergency is a multigenerational crisis, so the response must be multigenerational as well. I’ll join the strike next month, as will my partner and the child that has been growing within her since the last brutal summer. Younger generations are forming their response, and we must as well, for their sake. I’ll hold the memory of that apple as a reminder of this, and grow my children to do the same.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/all-blacks-hope-beauden-barrett-gamble-pays-off-to-avoid-repeat-of-history,"Settled combinations win Rugby World Cups and last-minute changes have seldom suited the reigning world champions Matt McILraith Mon 26 Aug 2019 19.00 BST Wednesday’s announcement of the All Blacks squad for the Rugby World Cup is unlikely to contain any surprises, but Steve Hansen still loves a punt. In moving Beauden Barrett from first five-eighth to fullback just two months – and four Test matches – out from the tournament in Japan, the noted racehorse owner has already taken arguably the biggest wager of his All Blacks coaching career. It is not so much the move itself that represents a risk, more the timing of it. In obstinately insisting previously that Richie Mo’unga had the benefit of a luxury ride behind the All Black-laden Crusaders forward pack – and so refusing to relocate Barrett to accommodate the younger man earlier – Hansen hasn’t given himself, or his team, a lot of adjustment time. History is also against him. Although dramatic late changes of personnel and their positioning are a surprisingly common feature of the All Blacks’ World Cup story, they have seldom worked. In 1991 an ageing side, unbeaten for 50 games through the previous three years, underwent dramatic change following a mid-year scare which saw the Wallabies get within a missed penalty goal of stealing the Bledisloe Cup. The blazers panicked and coach Alex Wyllie had John Hart parachuted in as co-coach. The two men had coaching philosophies and personalities as different as their Canterbury and Auckland homes, and did not see eye-to-eye. There was dramatic change on the playing front too; most notably veteran fullback Kieran Crowley being rushed from his Taranaki farm, and pitched straight into a semi-final in Dublin, after the coaching staff dithered on the options available within the touring squad. It ended in tears. The semi-final was all over by half-time, with the Wallabies running rings around the All Blacks and 13-0 ahead. At an end too was New Zealand’s hold on the World Cup. A decade earlier, New Zealand rock band Split Enz had had a smash hit with History Never Repeats. Unfortunately for the All Blacks, it has, and more than once. Hart was involved again eight years later, moving the world’s best fullback, Christian Cullen, to centre during the 1999 campaign. The idea had merit: he was also trying to fit Jeff Wilson, Jonah Lomu and Tana Umaga into his team; but it failed. Cullen was not the reason the All Blacks collapsed in the famous semi-final loss to France, but his discomfort in the role didn’t help. Two more World Cups, two more last-minute changes, and always at centre, unlucky 13. Injury to Umaga saw regular fullback Leon MacDonald thrust into the role in 2003. The current Blues coach didn’t throw the pass that Stirling Mortlock intercepted to win the Wallabies the semi-final, but his was a selection that was never forgotten, or forgiven. In 2007, it was Malili Muliaina’s turn. Muliaina played 83 of his 100 Tests as a fullback, but three at centre at the World Cup, where he was one of three used in the jersey across just five games. This indecision even more surprising given the All Blacks had been the No 1 side in the world by a mile between the 2003 and 2007 tournaments. Settled combinations win World Cups. The All Blacks proved that in 2011 and 2015, just as Australia and South Africa (both twice), and England, had before them. So, to 2019, and the Barrett gamble. There is no doubt the fullback position affords Barrett more time and space, which is important given the way rush defences have stressed him in recent times. Equally Mo’unga had shown for the Crusaders, as he did in the second Bledisloe Test, that he can control a game and ensure the team plays in the right areas of the field to ramp up the pressure and squeeze out of the opposition the mistakes the All Blacks feed off. Yet the two playmakers have already shown signs of getting in each other’s way under pressure. It looks like the change is also going to deny the All Blacks the calming influence of Ben Smith, whose voice and organisational skills from the back have been part of the glue that has held together the backline since their 2015 victory, a period where a number of young backs were introduced and prospered. At the last tournament, the All Blacks skilfully used Barrett as a change agent, bringing him off the bench when games were opening up, where his ability to spy an opening and run tiring defences ragged came off with spectacular effect. While most remember the five-pointer that sealed the final against the Wallabies, even more critical was his try three minutes after taking the field in the semi-final, which gave the All Blacks the lead for the first time as they edged South Africa 20-18. It is a formula that worked then. Perhaps it should be tried again. The All Blacks are chasing history in Japan, as the first team to win three straight titles. Where the current strategy with Barrett is concerned, the worry would be their repeating history of a less satisfactory kind."

It is not managing mine Rhik Samadder Tue 27 Aug 2019 08.00 BST Turning up to a Gymbox class called Cannabliss (membership from £73, gymbox.com) is my twofold nightmare. First, group exercise has always struck me as torture plus humiliation. Second, drug talk makes me feel 107 years old. When I hear anyone rhapsodising about hydroponics or closed-loop extraction or how to core an apple bong, I have a tremendous urge to shout: “Why didn’t you stay in school, you’re obviously smart?” Even if they’re in their early 40s. I suppose if we rebranded Stem subjects as Seed and Buds, we could stop failing our weed heads. Anyway, the idea of enduring their company while on a crosstrainer makes me want to pull a … whitey, is it? In my long shorts, I may as well have turned up to class wearing a baseball cap that reads: “How do you do, fellow kids.” I also arrive late, to fit in better with the apathetic stoners. It is my first mistake. They are all there, in their Lululemon and Nike athleisure gear, fit young professionals who regularly go to the gym and let their hair down with an extra broccoli floret at dinner. No one is here to get high. Cannabliss is a “recovery-focused class with the added benefit of CBD patches to help with inflammation”. The teacher glares at me for the disruption. I select a mat too close to his, having no choice because the other spots are taken. He hands me a translucent, spearmint-coloured square to apply to my upper arm. The fact that I have a photographer with me isn’t ideal, either. I am already feeling intensely uncomfortable, and we haven’t even begun. Perhaps we should back up, and explain CBD at this point. Cannabidiol has started springing up everywhere, in varied forms. In essence, it is just one of more than 100 chemical compounds that proliferate in the sweet flowers of Mary Jane and her wacky baccy. It is completely distinct from TLC, who were never able to match the highs of Waterfalls and No Scrubs, although Unpretty was pretty good. Hang on, hang on. *Squints* Oh, THC is the psychoactive element in cannabis – the main bit that gets you high, and there is little to none of it in CBD products. They are legal and said to help with pain relief, inflammation, epilepsy and depression. It is making use of the medicinal effects of cannabis, minus all the fun. I’m certainly not having fun at Cannabliss. I had hoped a class with the word “recovery” in the description would basically be lying down and listening to classical music, but in fact it is a series of intense stretches and body manipulations to help muscles recover after workouts. Rolling crossed thighs down foam rollers, putting a squash ball under our shoulders and riding all our weight on it, holding planks and twisting our cores. Sweat runs into my eyes relentlessly. Gimme the apple bong, I think. There is no drug talk, the patch being there to help manage the pain, then boost our recovery over the following 24 hours. It is not managing mine well enough, and I haven’t done the workout immediately prior to this that the masochists around me presumably have. I do think it is doing something, though. CBD patches are a more effective form of transferring cannabidiol into your bloodstream, unlike gummies or water infusions, which break down in the stomach along with your dignity. As I exercise, I can feel a light tingling under the patch. This is not as extreme as when you apply toothpaste to your swimsuit area, but more tingly than the beginnings of a cold sore. While CBD is not yet clinically proven, doctors and scientists are optimistic about its benefits. It is generally agreed there is something here worthy of study, and a weight of anecdotal evidence, not all of it from rock-loving dudes called Kevin or Cody or Sparrow. As far as this lazy, pain-averse, 107-year-old square is concerned, it is easier to not exercise so hard that you need to take either the recovery class or use the patches. Driven young professionals will find Cannabliss dope. After an hour of it, I’m ready to slap a DNR notice on my back. CBD is a pleasant thing to say. It rolls off the tongue, like BBC or DNA or FBI. CBD? CBA more like. 3/5"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.01 BST I vaguely enjoy sex with my boyfriend, but thinking about sex repels me and I feel self-revulsion after. I nearly climax, but always pull away before it happens. My boyfriend is 15 years older than me and I wonder if my feelings are to do with an underlying sense of power imbalance, even though I trust him and we act as equals. The simple and common phases of sex are desire – the feeling of wanting sex; then arousal – where the genitals and other parts of the body respond in preparation for sex; then further sexual thoughts, feelings and actions, which lead to orgasm. There can be interruption or dysfunction at any of these stages. In your case, you are unable to experience the first or last. Revulsion could be the result of past attitudes instilled in you, or of sexual coercion – current or past. Or you may simply not be attracted to your boyfriend. Denying yourself your climax by pushing him away suggests you are unable to allow yourself pleasure for some reason that must be uncovered. Or are you really denying him your orgasm? Are you harbouring resentment – possibly due to your sense that there is an unfair personal contract between you? Underlying anger towards a partner will certainly undermine desire, as well as sexual functioning in general, and must be addressed. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/26/rachel-roddy-friggitelli-peppers-with-tomatoes-recipe,"These small, finger-length peppers are sensational fried in olive oil and sprinkled with a little salt, or drowned in a ripe, garlicky tomato sauce Rachel Roddy Mon 26 Aug 2019 12.00 BST Friggitelli are small, elongated and slightly crumpled sweet peppers, and it is their season. While classed as sweet to reassure us that the hot gene is recessed, friggitelli peppers are, in fact, not sweet at all. Rather they are the David Byrne of vegetables: intensely savoury with thin, crisp flesh and, while there is no searing heat or spice, they have something ever-so-slightly piquant about them – the so-called trigeminal effect some ingredients cause, which, in this case, is a cooling in your mouth. Friggitelli also don’t suffer the unripe flavour of many green bell peppers, but have a sure, vegetal tone. Two hours down the coast from Rome in Naples, friggitelli are called friarelli, which is confusing as it is one letter away from friarielli, the local name for cime di rapa, or turnip tops (which, to add another layer of etymological confusion, are called broccoletti in Rome, even though they have nothing to do with the broccoli family). Peperoni friarelli, however, are part of the capsicum genus; members of the nightshade family; bright migrants from Mesoamerica to Europe in the 1400s. The word friarello derives from the Neapolitan dialect, che si frigge (meaning “that is fried”); three of the finest words reminding us in no uncertain terms of the best way to cook them. I don’t bother to remove the seeds, but rather throw the peppers whole into a frying pan in which I have heated a good amount of olive oil (lets say six tablespoons), until it is good and hot (but not smoking), and add a pinch of salt. Friggitelli make for lively cooking: they hiss like angry cats and occasionally leap in the pan – especially when you press them with the back of a wooden spoon, which splits the skins and releases liquid, which means they hiss all the more. You want the friggitelli to collapse and soften, for the skins to lightly char and ashen ever so slightly. To serve, tip the friggitelli on to a plate and sprinkle with salt – ideally flakes that crunch. As with larger bell peppers, cooking friggitelli turns them from crisp into soft and almost velvety. In Vegetable Literacy, Deborah Madison calls sauteed peppers or friggitelli “summer’s best bite, absolutely the best thing to nibble on with drinks”. She is right. To me, friggitelli are as much summer as long days, lollies and the smell of mosquito repellant. I would argue that “nibble” is too delicate a word here. The convenient thing about leaving friggitelli whole is the stem, which you can use to lift the whole thing into your mouth, which means tipping back your head like a peasant king. To take them one step further, lay anchovy fillets along the lengths of the cooked friggitelli (length-wise, they seem made for each other); the combination of the searing, salty fish with the soft green flesh is, as a drunk friend once pointed out, to die for. If you haven’t died from pleasure, you can prepare the second batch of friggitelli with tomato, another classic combination from Naples and Campania. Begin as you did with the fried peppers, letting them collapse and char in hot olive oil until they look like rumpled cloth. Before I add the peppers though, I scent the olive oil with garlic: peeled and cracked for a bold flavour, peeled and sliced for a stronger one. Once the garlic has given its scent and flavour, I remove it before searing the peppers – any more heat would burn the garlic; this makes it a bitter bully. Garlic lovers have no fear! I then return the garlic to the pan along with 500g tomatoes – halved if you’re using cherry, or peeled and roughly chopped for larger ones. Small or large, the important thing is that the tomatoes are ripe and sweet. Let them simmer at a blip, blip, burp, stirring from time to time and crushing the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon. You want the tomatoes to soften into a rich sauce that clings to the already-collapsed peppers, and catches the pools of now red-tinted olive oil. In the last minutes of cooking, when everything is a soft, crumpled mess, taste, add salt and a big handful of ripped basil, then leave to sit so the flavours mingle. Prep 10 minCook 30 minServes 4 500g friggitelli500g ripe tomatoes (cherry or large)2 garlic cloves6-8 tbsp olive oilSaltBasil To deseed the friggitelli, cut off the stalk end, split the pepper down the side and scrape out the seeds. Next, prepare the tomatoes: cherry tomatoes can simply be cut in half, while larger ones should be plunged into boiling water for 60 seconds, then into cold, at which point the skins should split so they can be pulled away. Roughly chop the tomatoes, discarding any hard bits. Peel and crush the garlic: for a mild scent, crush so it splits but remains whole, or peel and slice for a stronger one. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil and garlic over a medium-low heat until the garlic is fragrant. Now, lift out the garlic, otherwise it will burn and turn bitter; you can put it back in later. Add the friggitelli and a pinch of salt and fry, moving the peppers around and pressing them with the back of a wooden spoon, until they collapse and their skin turns opaque. Add the tomatoes (and garlic, if you want), raise the heat and continue the lively simmer for 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes are saucy. If the pan seems a bit dry, add a little water. Add the basil in the last minutes of cooking; taste and add salt as required."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 17.18 BST Sam Bennett doubled Ireland’s cause for celebration in the Vuelta a España as he took victory on stage three while compatriot Nicolas Roche kept the leader’s red jersey. Bora-Hansgrohe’s Bennett briefly looked to be out of position on the final approach to the harbourside line in Alicante, but once the 28-year-old turned on the power nobody was able to keep up and he took a comfortable victory. Ed Theuns (Trek-Segafredo) and Luka Mezgec (Mitchelton-Scott) came in second and third as Bennett laid down a marker in the first sprint of the race after looking off the pace a day earlier. “I can’t tell you how relieved I am with that,” he said. “I felt so bad yesterday, I can’t tell you how bad I was on the stage. Thanks to the team I could relax and follow them and trust in them and they got me in the right place at the right time to make my effort. If it wasn’t for the team today I wouldn’t have got it. “I’m delighted to get it. It means a lot to get another Grand Tour victory, especially in the Irish national champions jersey. I’m very proud to wear it.” The sprint finish meant no change to the general classification, in which Team Sunweb’s Roche leads by two seconds from Nairo Quintana of Movistar after finishing second to the Colombian on stage two. It was Bennett’s first career Vuelta stage victory and fourth in a Grand Tour after his star turn at last year’s Giro d’Italia. The 28-year-old has been in outstanding form this season, with this his 12th victory in total – yet he confirmed on the eve of the Vuelta he still does not have a contract for next season."

Last modified on Thu 22 Aug 2019 01.17 BST Los Angeles can sometimes feel like a sprawling hellscape of heat: in the northern valleys and the southern city, metal playground equipment, car steering wheels, even the ground itself effectively become weaponized. The more than 300 days of sunshine a year that for generations have made LA such an attractive place to live and visit are becoming a grave liability due to the climate crisis. The city gets so murderously hot all year-round, its residents routinely suffer heat-related death even in winter. Last summer, city residents in endured some of its highest temperatures ever recorded. Worse is likely to come. LA’s hot inland areas are projected to experience twice as many extreme heat days by mid-century; University of Maryland researchers project, on current emissions, that by 2080 the climate will be as hot as Baja California, Mexico, is now. That heat is not equitably distributed across the city’s geography, or its income brackets: inland suburbs regularly reach over 100F (38C) while the beach is 78F (25.5C) and breezy; wealthier neighborhoods enjoy shade-dappled walkways and abundant air conditioning, while poorer ones are largely exposed to the heat, both outside and inside. “There can be a 25F (14C) difference in just four to five miles as the crow flies, and a very different temperature future,” said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of nonprofit advocacy and coalition-building group Climate Resolve. “There has to be a variety of different strategies to help people cool down.” Los Angeles is embracing those strategies, in the vanguard of cities innovating to mitigate the damage of rising temperatures. But the challenges are substantial. Mayor Eric Garcetti has pledged to reduce the city’s temperature by 3F (1.6C) by 2050, as part of his updated climate adaptation plan. That will mean wrenching LA off its current heated trajectory, with temperatures in the region on pace to rise 3-5F (1.6-2.7C) by then. For Los Angeles, the changing climate means droughts will last longer and become more extreme, helping to fuel longer and more devastating wildfire seasons. Climate crisis will further diminish the already-taxed water stores upon which LA relies. At the same time, researchers expect more extreme “atmospheric rivers” – storms so massive they’re essentially waterways in the sky – that will infrequently, but decidedly, douse and overwhelm the city. Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. It’s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time. This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities. Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US Los Angeles must reconsider and reconstruct its infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends a multi-pronged, green infrastructure approach to combat the “urban heat island” effect, in which cities feel hotter than their greener, less populated surroundings. Some of that is now underway. The mayor’s climate adaptation plan includes a goal of increasing the total land area covered by cool surfaces by 10% by 2025, and 30% by 2045. Research from the Los Angeles Urban Cooling Collaborative found that infusing cooling measures in the built environment, from tree canopy to cool roofs to reflective streets, could reduce heat-related deaths in the city by 25%. “Health, transportation, buildings, social equity and justice – all manner of different expertise needs to be deployed to do this in the most effective way possible,” said Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance. “LA is one of the few cities that’s embraced the idea of being a test bed for all this stuff.” Few city projects have inspired as much apparent excitement as the pools of titanium dioxide-infused goo that Los Angeles has been spreading on its asphalt. “When we’re applying it, people come out and ask what we’re doing,” said Greg Spotts, assistant director of the Bureau of Street Services. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the LA Bureau of Street Services is hoping the reflective Cool Seal coating will reduce extreme heat in some of the city’s hottest neighborhoods. “Separate from the discussion about global warming, Angelenos’ experience is that their neighborhoods are getting hotter,” said Spotts. A one-quarter millimeter layer of Cool Seal costs about $0.60 per square foot, and can reduce surface street temperature by roughly 10F (5.5C). Spotts demonstrated the difference to the Guardian using a handheld infrared thermometer gun on a 98F (37C) day. We’ve noticed that even dogs and cats actually prefer to walk on the cool pavement coating “We’ve noticed that even dogs and cats actually prefer to walk on the cool pavement coating,” said Spotts. They’ll cross the street just to get to the cool stuff. In 2019, the agency expanded the experiment from single city blocks distributed across the region, to coating several blocks at a time in neighborhoods determined to be particularly vulnerable to urban heat based on local climate, lack of shade and economic disadvantages. “Originally, we thought this was about reducing air conditioning usage and the associated carbon emissions. But it’s really becoming more about public health,” said Spotts. Before cool streets, LA was the first city in the country to require cool roofs on new and renovated construction in order to reduce indoor temperatures without the use of air conditioning. The roofs worked so well, why not tackle the roads next? Streets make up about 15% of the city’s land, while parks comprise 13%. If heat-trapping, car-centric roads are one of LA’s biggest climate problems, they’re also a potential site of intervention. But the research on cool street cover leaves some open questions. According to a 2017 study, most cool pavement sealants were more resource-intensive than ordinary paving material. There’s also concern that staining on white roads could counteract their benefits. Alternatively, if they stay fresh and bright, some fear they could actually reflect the hot sun back at unsuspecting residents. Still, Spotts is undeterred. “The street is made of the same stuff it’s been made of since World War II,” said Spotts. “We think it’s time for cities and suppliers to experiment.” Permeable pavement is a far more subtle addition to LA’s climate resiliency schemes than cooling landcover. Unlike a gleaming white-coated street, the porous pavement and bioswales that catch and filter runoff don’t look like anything special. The dry wells that capture that water for reuse blend entirely into the urban landscape. On a tour of water-capturing green infrastructure, Kevin Ho, an LA city sanitation engineer, pointed to two metal covers set into the road, several feet in front of a massive storm drain. “When it rains, it’s like opening up a fire hydrant and pointing it down into the dry well – it just collects it all,” said Ho. “If possible, we would just put dry wells throughout the city.” In a partnership between the City Department of Water and Power, the Bureau of Sanitation and California State Coastal Conservancy, these experimental projects have been distributed across a handful of major thoroughfares and small residential side streets, with the goal of increasing local water security and reducing local heat. The mayor’s resilience plan calls for water infrastructure that “will ensure the city is prepared to handle both extreme wet and extreme dry years”. Right now, LA county gets 41% of its water from local underground aquifers and recycling – the goal is 50% by 2025. Permeable pavement, bioswales and dry wells can make the city better adapted to arid periods, and make flood-prone neighborhoods more resilient to superstorms. The distributed stormwater capture project in the San Fernando Valley stands to collect enough water to serve around 1,200 families per year. It’s a literal drop in the bucket, but the initiative is still in an early stage. “These projects are so spotty, and they’re at all different levels of green,” said Kara Kemmler, a coastal conservancy project manager. “I would love to see some more trees,” lamented Kemmler. “So you have that water capture, but create some shade, some carbon sequestration, some urban heat island mitigation while you have the opportunity. ” Creamy asphalt sealant lowers the surface temperature of a road roughly 10F. But the shade from a mature, leafy tree can provide more like 40-50F (22-28C) of cooling power, on top of sequestering carbon. “By and large the literature is kind of mixed on which one is ‘better’ – I’m a firm believer that we’ve got to do both,” said Edith de Guzman, executive director of the nonprofit Tree People. Trees seem to be the obvious adaptation fix to cool a city, recapture water runoff and increase local carbon capture. Earlier this month, the mayor’s office appointed LA’s first forest officer to oversee increasing the city’s canopy by at least 50% by 2028 in areas that currently have the least shade. “There’s all manner of state or other funding sources that will allow for tree planting to occur. But this is an asset that needs to be maintained,” said de Guzman. Instead of unilaterally taking on the project of greening LA, Tree People trains those who want to green their own neighborhoods, thus creating a network of tree-passionate planters and waterers. But compared to pouring reflective or permeable concrete, or installing a cool roof, planted greenery by its nature conflicts with the gray environment. Planting comes second to vehicle sightlines in the sprawling car-centric metropolis. And over time, the shallow roots on many of LA’s trees have torn up the pavement. The city recently settled a lawsuit that will require a $1.4bn investment in sidewalk, ramp and crosswalk repairs in order to make them disability-accessible. That settlement could provide an opportunity to green the city better by choosing more deep-rooted species. LA appears committed to a greener, shadier future – but the city has fallen short in past efforts to create cool cover. Trees have gone unplanted. Bus shelters have gone unbuilt. The city is losing transit riders to car travel, and climate crisis could only make it worse. A pilot at one large northwest valley transit station will create a variety of heat-beating infrastructure to make transit more attractive. “If you knew you’d be completely in the shade, that there was water waiting for you at the train station, wouldn’t that be an easier place for people to take transit?” said Parfrey. Just as LA’s critical warming is not evenly distributed, neither are its heat-relieving elements. You can see this green gap in aerial photos of the city: Wealthier neighborhoods are shielded by foliage, while poorer ones are exposed to the sun – sometimes by design, in order to provide clear sight lines for surveillance cameras. The gap in heat-beating infrastructure creates an inequitable distribution of health risk. While the city takes local wealth into account when determining where to install new heat-mitigating infrastructure, intracity inequality is not so easily paved over, from uninsulated buildings to higher proportional energy costs to longer waits at those unsheltered bus stops. “If you want to look at a single issue that separates the haves from the have-nots, it’s heat,” said Shickman. “Every negative effect of heat hits low income neighborhoods and people of color more.” Even for a city as apparently determined as Los Angeles, the investments and cultural change necessary to retrofit so much gray infrastructure are hard won. These projects are all still in a nascent stage. But every square inch of green infrastructure contributes to better adapting it to a hotter future. “We’re aware of the projections out there and the reality that we are in for a fairly scary trajectory for continued heating. We are expecting more mortality, more illness,” said de Guzman. “But while we adapt we also have a recognition that there’s an inherently optimistic way that we can go about the situation that we’ve been handed.” Climate advocates here see their role as two-fold: an urgency to green a gray LA and save lives, and to inspire greater climate action at the same time. “Of course, urban heat island isn’t the same thing as climate change. But there’s something we can do in the interim, and we hope cooling down the city is a gateway to more activism and awareness,” said Parfrey. “Because this is a marathon.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Last modified on Wed 21 Aug 2019 11.04 BST On a sweltering summer day in Washington, DC, Judy Williams pulls up to a homeless day center to fill her van with bottled water. The homeless outreach coordinatoris headed to the spots where she knows she’ll find people who are living outside. “I’ll make sure they’re not lying down on the ground, and tap their feet for a response,” Williams said. Inside the center, a few dozen people hide from the heat in a windowless room with cafeteria-style tables and loud televisions. Two nearby men’s shelters are also open around-the-clock instead of just at night because of a city-wide heat alert. There’s free lunch, as well as computers for job searching, laundry machines and showers – but managers say people also visit just to get out of the sun. The center is in the middle of warehouses and near a highway, and all the concrete radiates heat. Matthew King, a 44-year-old who works in a tire shop but is between homes, said he visits regularly, “especially when it’s hot.” Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. It’s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time. This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities. Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US “This is the hottest I’ve ever seen in July,” said King at the center, which is just a few miles from the White House rose garden where President Trump said in 2017 that the US will leave the Paris climate change accord. Residents of the US capital are regularly baked in heatwaves and endure stiflingly thick humidit. But much like many cities around the world, Washington DC is being slowly cooked by the human-driven climate crisis to the extent its entire character will be transformed. By 2080, researchers recently found, Washington DC’s climate will resemble what northern Mississippi or Dallas is like currently. Unless drastic action is taken to slash greenhouse gases, global heating will transform the climates of almost every community in the US by the time today’s children are entering retirement. Outdoors in Philadelphia will feel more like Memphis; New York City is set to morph into northeastern Arkansas; Houston and Miami have no US comparison, leaping instead deep into climates currently found in Mexico. “Every city gets warmer, none get cooler,” said Matt Fitzpatrick, a University of Maryland academic who formulated the climate projections for US cities, based on a range of heat and rainfall scenarios. In the lifetime of children today, a lot of these cities are going to be dramatically transformed Its research shows how 540 North American urban areas will by 2080 become, on average, “most like the contemporary climate of locations about 500 miles (805kms) away and mainly to the south.” The average temperature in US cities will rise by a blistering 9F (5C) by the end of the century, compared to the period of 1960-1990, if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t curbed. Some cities will be outliers – Fairbanks, Alaska, for example, is in danger of heating up by a sweltering 11.8F (6.6C). “Cities have built infrastructure for a climate that will no longer be there,” Fitzpatrick said. “They will have to live with more heat and, if they are on the coast, flooding too. In the lifetime of children today, a lot of these places are going to be dramatically transformed.” This new reality of searing heat is an existential one for those most vulnerable – the sick, the elderly and, in particular, the homeless. Washington officials estimate 6,521 people were experiencing homelessness this year, down 6% from 2018. In the broader metropolitan area, about 9,794 people are without homes. Laura Zeilinger, director of the Department of Human Services, said as the city heats up, her goal stays the same – to get people into homes. Zeilinger said she isn’t aware of any heat-related deaths in the city, although she does review any hypothermia-related deaths at the end of each winter. “It’s when people don’t have housing that the elements become life threatening,” Zeilinger said. It doesn’t take much of a temperature increase to permanently shift the expected climate of a city. Fitzpatrick found that a 9.8F (5.5C) average temperature increase during Washington DC’s winter would plunge it into what the deep south is like today. This scenario, possible if emissions aren’t curbed, would also make DC around 70% wetter. “When people hear about a few degrees in temperature rise they can think ‘that doesn’t sound too bad.’ This shows it can really have a big impact,” said Fitzpatrick, who has started to ponder the altered state of Cumberland, Maryland – the town he lives in. “It’s going to look more like southern Kentucky, more of a subtropical climate,” he said. “We get a fair amount of snow now but that’s all going to change. It’s going to be very different.” Washington DC has been given a recent glimpse into its future – a 92F (33C) burst of heat last May saw the city break a 105-year-old record for high temperatures. Sitting on the banks of two tidal rivers – the Potomac and the Anacostia – Washington DC is also essentially a delta city at growing risk of flooding as bursts of rainfall become more intense. It won’t just be uncomfortable, it will be a life or death challenge for many people City leaders have attempted to identify the threat and counter it. A climate resilience plan, released in April, states that DC’s temperature has already risen by 2F (1.1C) over the past 50 years, with a further 4.5F (2.5C) increase to come within 30 years. The number of “heat emergency days” in DC, where the heat index tops 95F (35C), is expected to occur on more than 50 days a year as the century draws to a close. “That means that, in 2080, our summer will be one long heat emergency,” the DC resilience document warns. This scorching new climate is set to heavily burden DC’s growing population, many of them low-income and struggling with housing affordability. Vulnerable people will likely suffer dehydration or heatstroke, with increasing use of air conditioning placing a strain on the electrical grid. Power outages will probably start to spike. “It will affect how people live, work and get around in the city,” said Jessica Grannis, adaptation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center. “It won’t just be uncomfortable, it will be a life or death challenge for many people. Once it starts getting very hot at night, people without air conditioning are going to be at serious risk if they can’t cool down properly.” Kevin Bush, DC’s chief resilience officer, has pledged to “make the city’s immune system stronger” to cope with this threat, comparing it to how cities in California prepare for the ructions of an earthquake. Under the resilience plan, all DC buildings must be retrofitted to cope with rising heat and flooding threats by 2050, with all new buildings adhering to stricter codes within 13 years. The most at-risk buildings may even be removed. There’s a plan to add more greenery to DC by planting more trees, which will provide shade, and other vegetation that will help soak up stormwater from heavy downpours. The curbsides of several major streets are already getting a makeover, with new plants being bedded in to help cool down the city. “If walk along the streets in DC at the moment you’ll see a lot of pavements being taken out in favour of plantings,” Grannis said. DC is, she added, “one of the most climate prepared cities in the US. Unfortunately it’s not quite the same everywhere.” Dallas, which has a climate that Washington DC is moving towards, is currently trying to muster its own response to the rising heat. By 2080, according to the University of Maryland research, Dallas is set to become more like New Orleans – nearly 9F (5C) hotter and nearly three times as wet. “We had a storm event a few weeks ago where 350,000 people lost power, trees were knocked over. People started to think we maybe aren’t as resilient as we thought, even when it’s not a Hurricane Harvey sort of event,” said James McGuire, director of environmental quality at the City of Dallas. Dallas’ situation is exacerbated by the vast sprawl of concrete at its heart. A third of its surface is made up of rooftops, parking lots, highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat. This gives Dallas one of the highest “urban heat island” effects in the US, with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas. Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year. Of all US cities, only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas, found a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation, which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions. We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before McGuire said the city hasn’t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs “a lot more trees.” A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support. McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when “impacts are so severe everyone will have to do something.” Dallas’s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn’t taken, according to a major US government assessment released last year. The city will also be prone to the whiplash of prolonged droughts interspersed by the drumbeat of heavier rainfall. Property on the banks of Trinity river, that runs through Dallas, has long received billions of dollars of flooding protection but there is less preparation for fresher challenges, such as protecting people working outdoors who risk keeling over in the heat. In January, Dallas City Council kickstarted an attempt to address this manifold problem by passing its first climate resolution. Most of its adaption plans, however, have yet to be formed or funded. “It’s the worst of all potential worlds, really,” McGuire said. “We are getting more asthma problems. We are getting more drought. We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before. We just hope the most dire projections won’t happen.” On another hot day in Washington, Tariq Daniels – who is currently between homes – ate lunch and charged his phone at a local grocery store. Daniels said the city has plenty of services, including the day centers, as well as free recreation centers and libraries. Daniels splits his time between the public spaces, his mosque and the grocery store, where he savors the quiet as a contrast to the noise of the shelter in which he currently sleeps. “You’ve got everything that you need,” Daniels said. “A lot of people have just given up. They’re doing drugs to the point where they’re numb to the outside temperature.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

First published on Tue 13 Aug 2019 20.52 BST The Philadelphia Orchestra rescinded an invitation to opera singer Plácido Domingo on Tuesday afternoon, and the LA Opera promised an outside investigation, after the Associated Press published a report in which several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Eight singers and a dancer told the AP they were sexually harassed by the Spanish tenor in incidents that spanned three decades from the late 1980s. The alleged harassment took place at venues including opera companies where the musician held top positions. Six other women allege that Domingo, 78, made them feel uncomfortable with his sexual propositions, and dozens of other people in the opera business claimed that they witnessed the multiple Grammy award winner being sexually inappropriate towards younger women. So far, four American opera houses have responded to the allegations. The Philadelphia Orchestra revoked an invitation for Domingo to appear with several other musicians at its opening night on 18 September. The orchestra said Tuesday that it’s “committed to providing a safe, supporting, respectful and appropriate environment”. The Los Angeles Opera, where Domingo is general director, issued a statement saying it will investigate the allegations. The company said in a statement: “LA Opera will engage outside counsel to investigate the concerning allegations about Plácido Domingo.” The statement noted that Domingo has been “a dynamic creative force in the life of LA Opera” for more than three decades, adding: “We believe all employees and artists should be treated respectfully and feel safe and secure within their work environment.” The Washington National Opera, where Domingo has served as a top manager for 15 years, said in a statement it has “zero tolerance policies” regarding harassment of any kind. Several performers told the AP that they were sexually harassed by the star while working for the Washington opera and that his behavior was common knowledge. A spokeswoman for the Washington opera declined to answer specific questions from the AP about whether management was aware of any inappropriate behavior by Domingo and if any complaints ever had been made. Instead, the opera house issued a statement saying that its goal “always is to ensure that all of our artists and employees can work and thrive in an environment of safety, trust, support, creativity and mutual respect”. The San Francisco Opera became the latest to respond when it announced late Tuesday that it was canceling an October concert featuring Domingo. The 6 October show had been to mark Domingo’s 50th anniversary with the San Francisco company. It had been promoted as a “special one performance-only event” with “one of the most influential singing actors in the history of opera”. The opera company said in a statement that even though no inappropriate behavior was alleged to have taken place in San Francisco, the company is “committed to its strong anti-sexual harassment policy and requires all company members to adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct”. Domingo has denied the accusations, but noted: “Still, it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable.” The women said they felt emboldened to come forward by the #MeToo movement that emerged after sexual harassment allegations against former film producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017."

I have asked the teenager from Kettering, Northamptonshire, to justify the many hours she spends alone in her room, perfecting fabulously complicated makeup looks. “That’s like saying to someone who does A-level art and is painting all the time, ‘Oh you shouldn’t be doing that, you should be doing something more academic.’ It’s just art, but it’s on your face.” Pulling out her phone, Provenzano shows me a list of makeup looks she would like to master. Her inspirations are diverse and obscure. “I’d really like to do an Error 404-inspired look,” she muses. “You know when something glitches online? It’s mainly black and white, but also green and red.” I browse the list – what does the “eyebrow slits … but everywhere” entry mean? “I’ve already done that one!” she says. “I’d just given myself an eyebrow slit, and I woke up in the middle of the night and thought, why not do it everywhere on my face? So I got a tiny brush and concealer, and drew lines through my makeup.” I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I’ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag Provenzano shows me a photo. Her eyes are orange. Her cheeks are a garish pink. There are thin lines down her face, as if her makeup has been stencilled around them. It is enormously impressive. After she finished the look, Provenzano uploaded a picture to Instagram, then washed the makeup off. “Sometimes I keep it on if I really like it,” she shrugs. “Then a few hours later, I’ll take it off.” Once, young people used makeup as visual code to gain admittance into different subcultures: black lipstick for goths, winged eyeliner for punks. Now, makeup is a subculture all of its own. In communities centred around Instagram and YouTube, young people gather virtually to look for inspiration, swap product tips and master tricky techniques. They often come to makeup through superstar vloggers such as NikkieTutorials (12.2m subscribers), Jeffree Star (15.6m subscribers) and James Charles, who boasts 15.9m subscribers, despite a series of scandals, one of which involved his former mentor releasing a 45-minute video claiming he had pressured heterosexual men to go out with him (claims he denied in another video), temporarily losing him millions of followers. Beauty is big business. The market research firm Mintel valued the UK beauty and personal care market at £10.2bn in 2018. Spending is up: 30% of women aged 16-24 say they shell out more than they did 12 months ago. Brands that work with popular influencers to corner the teen market will experience phenomenal growth – earlier this year, thousands of teenagers mobbed an appearance by Charles at the Birmingham store of the cosmetics brand Morphe. (The city was gridlocked for hours.) Popular makeup conventions such as Beautycon or Imats (the International Makeup Artist Trade Show) draw thousands, while young people compete on shows such as the BBC’s Glow Up to be recognised as Britain’s freshest makeup talent. In this community, your face is a canvas for incongruous, dreamlike, wearable art. All you need is some pocket money and a smartphone. But what is fascinating about this new subculture is that it is not taking place in crowded moshpits or twilit parks, but quietly in bedrooms. “I don’t go out much,” says Provenzano. “My friends come here or we go to their houses … but we don’t really go places.” Aiman Sheeraz, a 17-year-old from Manchester, says: “My favourite skill is blending. This is what YouTube has taught me – to blend my life away.” Sheeraz got into beauty because of her mum, who loved makeup. “We’d watch Asian bridal makeup tutorials and try to recreate them together. Looking back at the pictures, they were so horrific!” I sneakily told my mum I had a Halloween party so we could buy makeup. She asked, ‘Are you sure this is for Halloween?' After her mum died two and a half years ago, Sheeraz started doing makeovers on her family and friends, posting the results online. “I thought, why not get my talent out there?” At first, Sheeraz did the makeup thing to honour her mum. But soon it took on a life of its own. “It was never what I wanted to do full-time,” says Sheeraz, who is studying for an apprenticeship in accountancy. “It’s more something to do on her behalf and make her happy. But now I really enjoy it myself. I guess I’m doing it for her in a way.” As with any subculture, there are different tribes. Fans tend to divide into two camps: the first are lovers of the haute-glam look popularised by the Kardashian-Jenners and makeup artists such as Mario Dedivanovic and Kevyn Aucoin. Sheeraz falls into this category, describing her style as “Asian glam”: “a very glowy base, full coverage, bright lips and eyes, but also something that you can wear to weddings and events – it won’t just look nice in pictures.” Meanwhile, creative makeup fans prefer art-driven, colourful looks. “With creative makeup there aren’t many rules, you can do what you want,” says Niamh Dunne, a 19-year-old supermarket worker from Corby, Northamptonshire. Dunne takes inspiration from films or TV shows such as Stranger Things. After the Lion King reboot came out, she freehand-painted the amber and ochre colours of an African sunset on her chest. It took three hours. Critics may say that young people shouldn’t be messing around with blusher – they should be focusing on their careers. But this is wildly missing the mark: beauty is a very lucrative career choice. Just ask Kylie Jenner, who built a billion-dollar fortune off the back of her cosmetics company (although sales are rumoured to be down). Of the 80 women on Forbes’s so-called “self-made women” rich list this year, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries. Sheeraz wants to become like her idol, the beauty mogul Huda Kattan. “Being a woman of colour and getting to where she is from being an average person is really inspirational to me.” I wonder if any of the teens think it may be damaging to be so focused on their appearance. They all bat those concerns away. “Most of the time I’m actually barefaced,” Sheeraz says. “When I go to work, I don’t wear it, because I’d rather spend the time sleeping.” Dunne agrees: “With teenage girls, there is so much pressure on the way you look – getting surgery and lip fillers and all of that stuff,” she says. “I don’t think it should be like that. I don’t wear it because I think I need it. I wear it because I enjoy doing it.” It is not just girls who are perfecting makeup techniques you’ve never heard of, such as halo brows or lollipop lips. Brands such as Milk Makeup and Fluide have created genderless cosmetics ranges, while legacy players including Chanel and Givenchy have launched male lines. They are targeting consumers like 17-year-old Matt Tierney. “I remember sneakily telling my mum I had a Halloween party to go to when I was 14, so we could go to Superdrug and buy some makeup. She asked, ‘Are you sure this is for Halloween?’” He laughs. Through YouTube, Tierney built up the confidence to experiment with makeup. “If I didn’t see people doing it online, I’d never have gotten into it. I live in a little village in Northamptonshire. I’ve never seen anyone walking around with a rainbow eye or in drag. You don’t see that here.” Of course, marketing makeup to men doubles the amount of product brands can sell. And there is no doubt that consumerism is at the heart of this subculture – to an alarming extent. Provenzano takes me to her local Superdrug. “If I’m in town, I’ll come in to have a look,” she says, fingering a yellow Revolution eyeshadow lovingly. (Provenzano favours affordable brands – although she has a few high-end eyeshadow palettes by the US brand Lime Crime – that aren’t tested on animals.) Makeup influencers such as Jaclyn Hill have landed themselves in trouble with their young fanbases over the quality of their products – in one case, her lipstick was said to contain metal shards. Tierney bought the James Charles x Morphe palette after seeing it hyped online. “I didn’t think it was that great, to be honest. Maybe everyone saying it was amazing was on his payroll.” Regulators have started to step in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission wrote to high-profile influencers to warn them against “stealth shilling”, where they fail to disclose they are being paid by brands. Earlier this year, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority secured formal commitments from celebrities to be more transparent about paid-for endorsements. Even then, young people may not be able to recognise when their favourite online makeup artists are pushing products because they are paid to advertise them. “What we see in the research is that they don’t really recognise the advertising in vlogs or on Instagram as advertising, as much as they do on TV,” warns Steffi de Jans of Ghent University. She characterises most beauty vlogs as effectively advertising: the vloggers are either being paid by the brand directly, or receiving free products. And this isn’t just a 30-second cereal advert in a commercial break. “It’s hours and hours in a row of advertising messages, and they’re really engaging with it.” Subcultures have always been consumer-adjacent: you buy records, safety pins, miniskirts. But the act of consumerism isn’t peripheral to this emerging beauty subculture – it’s integral to it. This is consumerism as subculture. Sheeraz estimates she has spent about £1,000 on products from brands including Anastasia Beverly Hills and Huda Beauty, whose palettes retail for £40 to £60. Can a community that is so predicated on consumer consumption truly be considered a subculture? Probably not, says Dr Rehan Hyder of the University of the West of England, explaining that it is better to think of these teenagers according to the concept of creative fandom, as coined by academic Henry Jenkins. “Fans aren’t just consumers, but producers. They’re not participating passively, but creating a community in which you share expertise, skills and collective intelligence.” In the beauty world, they use makeup to establish themselves as persons of influence and skill – like Tierney, who aims to achieve 100k followers. “That would be a massive milestone,” he says. As teenage pursuits go, however, it is hard to think of a more clean-living way for young people to be spending their time – a bottle of shoplifted vodka being passed around a park this is not. “I’m not really a going-out person,” says Dunne. “You just get hungover and can’t be productive the next day.” Tierney thinks that makeup gives young people something to do. “It’s quite wholesome,” he laughs. “People who have no lives, sitting in their room with a ring light on, blending makeup on their eyes!” (He recently got one of these lights himself.) Ring lights, contour kits, an arsenal of brushes to make Picasso blush: for teenagers today, makeup isn’t a superficial hobby, but a way of expressing their creativity, hopes and dreams. Back in her bedroom, Provenzano does my makeup while telling me about her ambitions for the future – she aspires to be a makeup artist for fashion shows. “Going to London,” she says dreamily, eyeshadow brush in hand. “The fashion weeks – Milan, London, Paris. Obviously I can’t stay in Kettering and do runways, because it’s so small.” And as she applies my eyeshadow with precision of a surgeon performing keyhole surgery, I close my eyes and think: “You’ll get there.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/27/it-smells-like-a-decomposing-body-north-carolinas-polluting-pig-farms,"After years of burying neighbours’ complaints about illegal spraying of hog manure, state officials suddenly began posting them online. What changed? Barry Yeoman Tue 27 Aug 2019 07.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 15.27 BST In September 2016, with Hurricane Hermine bearing down on North Carolina, Kemp Burdette rented a single-engine plane and flew over Duplin county. Burdette, a riverkeeper with the environmental group Cape Fear River Watch, was worried that some of the local pig farmers might try to drain their manure lagoons before the rains hit, to prevent them from overflowing. Spraying waste is illegal just before storms because of the risk that runoff from saturated fields will contaminate waterways. As he flew, Burdette estimated that he saw at least 35 farms spraying their fields. He took high-resolution, GPS-stamped photographs and videos documenting the apparent violations, and then filed a complaint with the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), hoping the evidence would move the agency to act. He and his colleagues did the same a month later, just before the devastating Hurricane Matthew. “This isn’t just one bad actor,” he said. “This was widespread – complete disregard for the rules.” But, according to Burdette, DEQ told him that the images were inadequate proof. “They were basically saying, ‘There’s nothing we can do,’” he said. “They can’t stand behind evidence collected by somebody else.” Nor did they have funds to do their own aerial surveys. For evidence, DEQ said it could only review the farms’ self-reported spray logs. And in November 2016, when Burdette and his colleagues followed up, they say all public traces of their complaints had disappeared. For years, residents say, North Carolina regulators shielded the identities of polluting farms, burying public complaints against them and leaving those who lived nearby with few avenues for redress. Neighbours said their complaints were going unheard. A joint investigation by the Guardian, the Food & Environment Reporting Network, and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting backs up residents’ assessments. In response to a public records request, DEQ released only 33 public complaints against livestock operations in North Carolina from January 2008 to April 2018. Over the same period, other hog states have registered thousands. Abruptly, in April 2019 the DEQ said it had validated 62 complaints against animal operations over a six-month period and posted them online. The offenders included 11 industrial hog farms, some of which had let their waste discharge into ditches and streams. State regulators had publicly documented nearly twice as many violations in the six months prior to April 2019 than in an entire decade. What happened? Raising hogs in North Carolina used to be a side gig to the real business of growing tobacco and cotton. Then, in the 1980s and 90s, the industry exploded, with concentrated animal feeding operations (Cafos) on the state’s coastal plain housing up to 60,000 animals each. Most of the state’s 9 million pigs live indoors, their waste flushed through slats into open pits called lagoons. When the lagoons get too full, the waste is sprayed onto crop fields as fertiliser, though these manure pits have also been known to overflow and breach their walls, particularly during hurricanes.As the industry grew, the state legislature protected it in numerous ways, even barring counties from restricting hog farms during the key expansion years. But lawmakers couldn’t ignore the mounting hog waste, particularly when it polluted waterways. It smells like a body that’s been decomposed for a month In 1997, the legislature imposed a suspension on new farms using lagoon-and-sprayfield systems: in 2007 it made the ban permanent, essentially capping the number of hog farms at around 2,300. But existing industrial farms were allowed to continue business as usual, despite widespread evidence that they were fouling the rural landscape and making for noxious neighbours. “It smells like a body that’s been decomposed for a month,” says Rene Miller, a retired truck driver from Duplin County, the heart of hog country. On Sundays after church, her family used to gather under the oak tree beside the house. They would dance, play checkers, and eat fried chicken, collard greens and corn. “That was my life back then,” she said. Now, with hog waste sprayed onto a field across the road, she stays inside with the air-conditioning cranked up. A study published in 2018 by the North Carolina Medical Journal concluded that families living near hog CAFOs saw higher rates of infant mortality and deaths from anaemia, kidney disease, and tuberculosis. Another study, from 2014, found these issues “disproportionately affect” people of colour: African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are far more likely to live near CAFOs. The North Carolina Pork Council declined an interview request, but has in the past criticised the study from 2014. In comments submitted to DEQ last March, the council also noted that the 2018 North Carolina Medical Journal study came from a research programme at Duke University that received funding from a critic of factory farming. The industry insists that health concerns are exaggerated. “We don’t think these types of symptoms or things are going on in the communities where we do business,” Kraig Westerbeek, a senior director at Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer and the state’s dominant player, said in a deposition in reference to an older study that had found increased depression, anger, and confusion among neighbours who experienced hog-farm odours. “There are studies that can say almost anything,” he added. The ban on lagoons and spraying only applies to new farms. Meanwhile, North Carolina’s legislators appear to have continued to protect existing farms and discourage neighbours from seeking help. In 2014, for example, they passed a law keeping complaints filed with the state environmental agency confidential unless the department “determines that a violation has occurred”. State representative Jimmy Dixon said the provision was designed to protect farmers from false accusations. “We fully expect and desire to have any violations known and exposed,” the Duplin County Republican and semi-retired poultry farmer said in an interview. “But just to throw it wide open for every Tom, Dick and Harry to make unsubstantiated claims, like some of the people do – we believe that there is an inherent expectation that I should be determined to be innocent until proven to be guilty.” DEQ interpreted the law to require disclosure of a complaint only when there’s a formal violation notice or penalty, which the agency has historically been loth to initiate. “We believe [that] if they find a violation of the permit, they just tell the operator, ‘Hey, this doesn’t look right. You need to address it,’” says Elizabeth Haddix, managing attorney at the North Carolina office of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which represents some of DEQ’s critics. “They may not make any written record of that violation.” This is how, until recently, complaints vanished. It also helps explain why the agency located only 33 complaint records for a period of more than a decade, when queried by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. Other states with major livestock industries had far more: Nebraska provided 2,131 complaints; Georgia 5,652; and Texas 6,411. Iowa, the top hog producing state, provided 2,393. The North Carolina Pork Council, in a 2019 letter to DEQ, said the “relatively minimal number of violations” in the state signalled “a robust and working regulatory system”. But even careful documentation hasn’t guaranteed enforcement in North Carolina. DEQ spokesperson Sharon Martin would not discuss the complaints filed by Burdette and his colleagues after the 2016 storms. She did acknowledge the animal operations programme “is underfunded due to the last decade of budget cuts”. Feeling unprotected by regulator, North Carolinians living near hog farms have turned to the courts, with more than two dozen lawsuits by more than 500 plaintiffs against Smithfield Foods’ hog-production subsidiary. Others looked to the machinery of federal and state government to hold DEQ accountable. In September 2014, the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, and Waterkeeper Alliance filed a complaint with the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Civil Rights. It said that DEQ had failed to consider the disproportionate harm to people of colour when it issued that year’s permit governing nearly all large hog operations, violating federal civil rights laws. The permit is issued every five years. The North Carolina Pork Council described the complaint as part of a “coordinated, multi-pronged attack on our farmers”. EPA investigators visited North Carolina and interviewed more than 60 hog farm neighbours. The residents described strong stenches that made them gag, vomit, and lock themselves indoors. Several also mentioned keeping silent, because “for more than 15 years, the government has been well aware of the conditions they have to live with, but has done nothing to help, so complaining to North Carolina DEQ would be futile,” the EPA wrote in a letter to DEQ. Those who did complain reported “threats, intimidation, and harassment” by the industry. Finally, in December 2016, advocates challenged the complaints system head-on, filing a separate petition with the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings, alleging that DEQ had failed to investigate complaints against hog farms. The groups pointed to the photographic evidence of illegal spraying just before Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Matthew and the later disappearance of those complaints. This multifaceted campaign began to bear fruit in 2017, after a change ofleadership in North Carolina. Incumbent Republican Pat McCrory was replaced by Democrat Roy Cooper, and he appointed former Environmental Defense Fund official Michael Regan to head DEQ. “We all had high hopes,” Naeema Muhammad, the Environmental Justice Network’s organising co-director, said of the new administration. Shortly after the inauguration, DEQ issued “notices of deficiency” to nine farms that had sprayed their fields right before Hermine, requiring the farms to take corrective action. These farms included five that Burdette said he had photographed the previous September. DEQ based its findings on the farmer-reported logs. The new DEQ leadership also sat down with the advocates and hammered out two settlements. In the EPA civil-rights complaint, DEQ agreed to tougher oversight in its permits for large hog operations. It would improve air and water monitoring, and would develop a mapping tool to analyse whether people of colour were disproportionately harmed by its decisions. In the other settlement, DEQ agreed to implement a new system for investigating complaints, and to post six months’ worth of data. The first posting covered November 2018 through April 2019, showing DEQ received 138 complaints and found 62 violations. When it comes to how regulators handle complaints, “the settlement was a game-changer,” says Haddix. But the results of legal challenges to the industry have not been entirely positive. Juries have returned five verdicts against Smithfield. The awards have ranged from $102,400 (£83,642) to $473.5m, though the largest were reduced under state law. But the legislature responded to the suits by limiting neighbours’ future rights to sue and collect damages. Smithfield did not respond to interview requests. In an email, it called the largest award an “outlier verdict” and noted that appeals are pending. And DEQ declined to comment when asked if it had adopted a more aggressive policy. Advocates describe what Haddix calls a “bunker mentality” at the agency – a fear of appearing too proactive. For example, DEQ missed its own 1 April deadline for creating the mapping tool. It then said the tool was “educational” and “not intended for regulatory purposes”. “What the hell good is a community-mapping programme if it’s not going to slow down the degradation?” asks Muhammad. Given the legislative climate, and lawmakers’ control over the state budget, environmentalists say they’re not surprised by the timidity at DEQ. “When I think of ‘agency capture’, it’s not just a product of wilful decisions not to enforce, or wilful decisions to demonstrate favouritism to the industry,” said Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance. “Some of it is agency aversion to the risk that may result from taking action against an industry that is favoured at the legislature.” In calls and emails, DEQ’s Martin would not discuss the political climate or the threat of legislative backlash. DEQ officials were not available for interviews. “That is all I am able to provide at this time,” she wrote. This story was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting."

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 10.57 BST Terence Davies, one of Britain’s most original film-makers, said he would never have made his autobiographical classic Distant Voices, Still Lives if Freda Dowie had not agreed to play his mother in it. She has died aged 91. Dowie, a character actor with a mournful look, portrayed this matriarch of a Liverpool working-class Catholic family during the 1940s and 50s with stoicism, forbearance and a quiet solitude, as her character – and her children – endured beatings from her husband, played by Pete Postlethwaite. Despite Davies saying he toned down the violence, Dowie recalled: “It was tough working with Pete, as he was full of anger then. You could see why Terry cast him.” The director had seen Postlethwaite’s potential to explode into fits of rage, while being intent on casting Dowie after spotting her playing a string of victims on television. Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988), made in the lyrical, evocative style ever present in Davies’s work, is presented as fragments of a family’s life, complete with singsongs in the pub. However, the harshness prevents it from being nostalgic, instead merely bringing to the screen memories of a childhood. Although Postlethwaite credited the film as his breakthrough, it never achieved the same fame for Dowie. But it did bring her opportunities to take character roles in groundbreaking television dramas. In Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1989), based on Jeanette Winterson’s autobiographical novel about Jess, a girl growing up in a Pentecostal household in Lancashire and coming to understand her sexuality, she played Mrs Green, a fellow church member of the girl’s controlling mother (Geraldine McEwan). Mrs Green’s piety is questioned when her mood changes from devout and glum to appearing to revel in holding a wine glass to a wall to eavesdrop on a “fornicating” couple. Later Dowie appeared in Our Friends in the North (1996), Peter Flannery’s epic nine-part drama paralleling four Newcastle friends’ emotional upheavals over more than 30 years. She brought a quiet dignity to the role of Florrie Hutchinson, stuck in the middle between the socialist idealism of her son Nicky (Christopher Eccleston) and the disillusionment of her trade unionist husband Felix (Peter Vaughan), a former Jarrow marcher. On finding a machine-gun under her son’s bed, Florrie – another Catholic – goes to church to pray for his soul. She later shows fortitude as Felix battles Alzheimer’s disease – until she can cope no longer and allows him to move to a care home. In the final episode, set in 1995, Nicky returns from Italy for Florrie’s funeral, which marks the transfer of the “older generation” mantle to the “friends”. Dowie herself followed no faith, although she did explore the thoughts and sayings of the Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba – ultimately rejecting his belief that he was the Avatar, God in human form. Born in Carlisle, Cumbria, Freda was the daughter of Emily (nee Davidson) and John Dowie, who sold fried fish. At Barrow girls’ grammar school she passed her higher school certificate at 18, excelling in French, German and Latin, as well as English literature. After training at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London she worked as an acting coach and became principal of the North West School of Speech and Drama in Southport, Merseyside, also adjudicating at local festivals and school competitions. In 1958 she switched to acting, and began performing in repertory theatres. Within a few years her talent was recognised by the Royal Shakespeare Company, whose experimental group cast her as Mug in Boris Vian’s play The Empire Builders at the New Arts theatre club, London, in 1962. Two years later she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in the same group’s Theatre of Cruelty season at the Lamda theatre club in London, under the director Peter Brook. Dowie also acted in a string of Greek tragedies, notably with a moving performance in the title role of Electra, alongside Derek Jacobi’s Orestes, at the Greenwich theatre (1971). At the same venue a year later she played Queen Victoria in Brunel. Her 50-year television career, beginning in 1959, included parts as Princess Marie in War and Peace (1963), Fanny Thornton in North and South (1966), the Mother Superior helping at a refuge for vagrants and alcoholics in Jeremy Sandford’s play Edna, the Inebriate Woman (1971), Miss Branwell in The Brontës of Haworth (1973), the dual role of The Sybil and Caesonia in I Claudius (1976), Sally Brass in The Old Curiosity Shop (1980), Rachel Wardle in The Pickwick Papers (1985), Maria Insull in Sophia and Constance (1988), Mrs Waule in Middlemarch (1994) and Dulcie Green in Common as Muck (1994 and 1997). Dowie’s rare big-screen roles included nuns in the horror films The Omen (1976) and The Monk (1990). On BBC radio, as well as acting in dozens of plays she was a popular Morning Story and poetry reader and in 1960-61 played Aliss Oliver in the soap opera Mrs Dale’s Diary. Her first two marriages, to Lionel Butterworth in 1952 and John Goodrich in 1961, ended in divorce. Her third husband, the artist, Times art critic and maker of arts documentaries David Thompson, whom she married in 1970, died in April this year. • Freda Mary Dowie, actor, born 22 July 1928; died 10 August 2019"

But she became ill again, so now All of Me is unashamedly bleak. Her depression is interwoven with myth, switching abruptly from ancient narrative to everyday hopelessness. One moment, Horton is approaching the guardians of the underworld; the next, she’s lying on the floor in unwashed clothes. Through layers of storytelling, song and looped sound we hear the overwhelming noise of despair – as well as its occasional absurdity.

Lucy McCormick’s ludicrous performance-lecture-cum-cabaret-cum-rage-room is built with so many layers of irony and mockery that its core would be rotten by the time you dug down to it. If only more history lessons were like this. Within minutes she’s intimately licking one of her backing dancers. But far more than a gratuitous joke, this singalong search for a hero is a sabre-toothed comedy about women’s place in the limelight. KWAt Soho theatre, London, 3-14 December.Read our four-star review Baby ReindeerIf you followed Richard Gadd’s career up to his Edinburgh comedy award-winning Monkey See Monkey Do three years ago, you might think he’d had his lifetime’s fill of trauma and that happily, it had culminated in that cathartic triumph.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/27/deloitte-uk-partners-in-line-for-biggest-payday-in-10-years-accounting,"Average payout of £882,000 comes amid criticism of UK’s big accounting firms Sean Farrell Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.20 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.50 BST Hundreds of partners at the UK arm of accountancy firm Deloitte are in line for their biggest payday in a decade despite widespread criticism of Britain’s big accounting firms and their substandard audit work. The average payout for the 699 equity partners at the firm this year is £882,000. The cash sum covers the year to 31 May and is £50,000 more than they were paid the previous year. Some of the partners will be paid less than the average, but many will be handed more than £1m. Deloitte has 19,000 staff and 1,070 are partners. However, some 300 of the partners are “salaried” and do not take part in the profit distribution. One in five of the partners are female. Deloitte is the first of the big four UK accountants to report its 2019 results. The firm’s revenue, which also includes income from Switzerland, increased nearly 11% to almost £4bn and the amount of profit distributed to equity partners was increased from £584m to £617m. Britain’s big accountancy firms have been criticised by politicians and regulators over lax auditing of companies, anticompetitive practices and conflicts of interest. Scrutiny of the firms increased after a string of corporate collapses including Carillion and BHS – companies which had been given a clean bill of health by their auditors. Deloitte and its big rivals PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and EY dominate the market for auditing Britain’s largest companies and have used those relationships to sell more profitable consultancy services. Deloitte last year generated £582m of revenue from audit work, £952m from consulting, and £862m for tax and legal services. In April this year the Competition and Markets Authority stopped short of calling for the big four to be broken up after a review of “serious competition problems”. Its final report called for them to put greater distance between their audit work and more lucrative consultancy operations to prevent conflicts of interest, but also warned the businesses it would look again at forcing them to break apart if the profession did not improve in the next five years. In a withering review of the overall audit market, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) found the quality of Deloitte’s audits declined in 2017-18, although it said the firm had performed better than some others. Deloitte said it had made investments in its audit practice that would not have been possible without revenues from its other businesses. Deloitte said 84% of its FRC-inspected audits were judged acceptable last year compared with 76% in 2017-18, although that was still below the regulator’s target of 90%. Stephen Griggs, Deloitte’s managing partner for audit and assurance, said: “We have been consistent in our support for change in the audit market and are positive about many of the proposals that have been put forward.” He added: “However, we do not agree with proposals that would see any form of separation of the audit business from the rest of the firm. Audit quality is considerably enhanced by the investment capacity and access to specialists that being part of a much larger and diverse multidisciplinary firm allows.” Deloitte said its distributable profit increase was caused by one-off gains, including the sale of an investment, and currency swings. Without these items, profit would have been unchanged, it said."

Last modified on Tue 20 Aug 2019 09.32 BST It might be set in space rather than on an Earth ravaged by nuclear war, but there is a strong argument that The Outer Worlds, a forthcoming first-person role-playing game (RPG) by storied developers Obsidian, is spiritually a Fallout game. Not only is it directed by Fallout creators Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, it shares a lot of DNA with Obsidian’s Fallout: New Vegas – a spin-off with a reputation as the best in the series. New Vegas earned particular praise for its dialogue, and a world-building background that makes it feel like more than a thin justification for firing mini-nukes at super-mutants. New Vegas was Obsidian’s first and last game set in the Fallout universe, but The Outer Worlds places similar importance on freedom of choice in dialogue and gameplay. In this world, where mega corporations are starting to take over alien planets, you can act like a hero, an opportunistic mercenary, or a total idiot. The writing is sharp, snappy and funny, the world exciting and vibrant, and there’s a classic New Vegas interplay between factions of characters, any of whom the player can help or hinder. The genre of choice-based, do-what-you-like narrative game that The Outer Worlds inhabits – sometimes called “immersive sims” – is one I love. But it has ossified so much that a 2019 game can build on the legacy of one from 2010 without needing to change much. This year’s E3 games expo was a stark reminder of how formulaic games in this mould have become. Showing off The Outer Worlds for the first time, Obsidian had the player arriving on a new planet and heading off obediently to infiltrate a facility on the ask of a quest-giver. Depending on whether the player’s character is created for intelligence, stealth, strength or whatever else, they can go in guns blazing; sneak around without being noticed; or use a combination of charm, intimidation, persuasion and hacking to waltz in as if they own the place. But on meeting the head of the facility, there’s a twist: they offer to double your fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you. When I went to see the near-future action-RPG Cyberpunk 2077, Polish developer CD Projekt showed the player arriving in a new part of the game world, heading off to meet a quest-giver and being told to infiltrate a facility. You can take three broad approaches, we’re told: go in guns blazing; sneak around; or chat your way inside. But once again, on meeting the head of the facility, they offer to double the fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you there in the first place. In tone and style, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Outer Worlds are different: one is a gritty, violent, urban affair, the other colourful sci-fi. But the fundamental skeleton the games are built on is so constricting that, given an hour to show off everything they could be, both developers independently converged on a near-identical script. Genre conventions like this have their advantages. Film has embraced the three-act structure for years; pop songs have settled on a rhythm of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. They provide creators with structure and familiarity on top of which innovation can occur without fear of alienating audiences. But every now and again, a game comes along which shows that innovation can happen without putting people off and revives a genre in the process. The Ubisoft model was once to open-world games what the Fallout model is to first-person RPGs. The blueprint: climb towers to unlock new areas, sprinkle a map with icons representing mini goals to reach, make progress at your leisure. It underpinned Ubisoft’s Assassins Creed, Far Cry and Watch Dogs series, Warner Bros’ Batman and Middle Earth franchises, and many others. Then came The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in 2017. It’s got the towers, the open-world, and the plethora of smaller activities to distract you from the main noble quest. But it quietly revolutionised that stale old structure. Nothing in Breath of the Wild is gated. If you wanted (and you were extremely skilled) you could simply walk to the final boss and finish the game, though you would be far more likely to be lasered to death by guardian robots on the way up to the castle. The icon-filled map is almost entirely gone: only fast-travel points and the occasional quest-line show up. The rest is there for you to discover with your eyes and ears, rather than following objective markers like an orienteering enthusiast. I’m looking forward to The Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk 2077. But their genre needs its Breath of the Wild moment: an outsider to toss out the conventions, and build something beautiful from what is left. Surely choosing between shooting, stealthing or sweet talking can’t be the only options that the next generation of virtual worlds have to offer."
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/13/placido-domingo-accused-sexual-harassment,"Allegations ‘deeply troubling’ – I believed my relationships were consensual, says opera star Angela Giuffrida in Rome and 
Imogen Tilden Tue 13 Aug 2019 13.20 BST


First published on Tue 13 Aug 2019 10.18 BST The opera singer Plácido Domingo has been accused by several women of sexual harassment. Eight singers and a dancer said they were sexually harassed by the Spanish tenor in incidents that spanned three decades from the late 1980s, Associated Press reported. The alleged harassment took place at venues including opera companies where the musician held top positions. Six other women allege that Domingo, who has been married to his second wife, the soprano Marta Ornelas, since 1962, made them feel uncomfortable with his sexual propositions. Dozens of other people in the opera business claimed that they witnessed the multiple Grammy award winner being sexually inappropriate towards younger women. His alleged actions were “an open secret” in the opera world, Associated Press (AP) reported. Domingo, 78, did not respond to detailed questions from the news agency, but said in a statement: “The allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as 30 years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate. “Still, it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions. I believed that all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual. People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone.” One woman accused Domingo of putting his hand down her skirt and three others said he forced kisses on their lips in a dressing room, hotel room and at a lunch meeting. “A business lunch is not strange,” one of the singers told AP. “Somebody trying to hold your hand during a business lunch is strange or putting their hand on your knee is a little strange. He was always touching you in some way, and always kissing you.” Seven of the accusers claimed that their careers were affected after they rejected his advances, with some saying promised roles never materialised. Only one woman, the mezzo-soprano Patricia Wulf, consented to her name being used in the AP investigation. Others said they wanted to remain anonymous because they still worked in the business and feared reprisals. The women told similar stories about the singer allegedly calling them late at night and asking them to meet urgently under the guise of offering them career advice. The women said they felt emboldened to come forward by the #MeToo movement that emerged after sexual harassment allegations against the American film director Harvey Weinstein in 2017. Domingo added in his statement: “I recognise that the rules and standards by which we are and should be measured against today are very different than they were in the past. I am blessed and privileged to have had a more than 50-year career in opera and will hold myself to the highest standards.” Domingo performs regularly in London, most recently in January in the Royal Opera House’s production of La Traviata. He is due to return to Covent Garden in June 2020 in a revival of Verdi’s Don Carlo. In a statement on Tuesday the Royal Opera House said: “The ROH has not been made aware of any accusations pertaining to Placido Domingo’s time as a visiting artist or conductor. However, we have a zero tolerance policy towards harassment of any kind and recently refreshed our code of conduct to ensure all staff and visiting artists abide by the rules at all times.”"

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 10.52 BST It’s difficult to be good at golf when you have a swing like an industrial digger gouging trenches. When I was young, I tried so hard to be good at golf. However, my JCB technique was just one of a complex cocktail of technical challenges I faced when surveying the first hole before another wretched round. Weekend golfers deploy a curious lexicon when describing the entrails of a bleak day out on the course. They talk regrettably about having a poor “touch around the greens”, but at least you have to reach the vicinity of the green to have a touch. Long before then, I’d conceded the hole while knee deep in heather. Others talked about “getting up and down in two”. My shots often went up but rarely came down within anyone’s range of visibility. My golfing phrase-book consisted of “fore”, “play through” and “I’ll just take another ball”. I developed a keen interest in the flora and fauna of streams and hedgerows. On an average round of golf I was a major threat to nesting field birds and soon took to leaving the others at the ninth hole and waiting for them in the clubhouse. If I hadn’t quickly renounced this game and all its empty promises, I’d have developed profound alcohol issues and the RSPB would have issued “Wanted” posters. Perhaps if I’d been permitted to become a full member of a club, some of these problems could have been ironed out with the help of the professional, although this is doubtful. In Scotland in the 1980s, it was easier to get into the Long Room at Lord’s than to become a member of a decent club. Many seemed to pride themselves on having interminably long waiting lists and you were often told that if you were Catholic, Jewish or female you needn’t bother. In Glasgow, the Jewish community built their own course simply to guarantee membership. Many clubs had arcane house rules and I was often asked to leave for breaking the strict dress code. This seemed to consist of dark blazers and light trousers, an unforgiving ensemble for sclerotic, middle-aged men when the soup began to spill and the visits to the gents grew more frequent. There were professional reasons why women in particular faced widespread discrimination. Promotions and senior appointments in certain spheres of British industry weren’t gained by qualifications and a good interview: they were conferred in some Royal and Ancient redoubt after 18 holes and a bottle of Glenglaikit in these male-only environments. Brexit, the 2008 banking crisis and many miscarriages of justice involving police and the judiciary were probably spawned in these hideous places. ‘Brexit, the 2008 banking crisis and many miscarriages of justice involving police and the judiciary were probably spawned in these hideous places.’ Thus you are tempted to gloat at news of a crisis in Scotland’s golf clubs. This country has more than 570, an astonishing number for a country of barely five million people. In recent years, memberships have dwindled and clubs that were once proud of their exclusivity have taken to advertising cheap memberships in garish posters hung about their hallowed gates. This year, several clubs have faced closure, including two of the oldest in the west of Scotland. Following a spate of closures six years ago, Hamish Grey, the then chief executive of the then Scottish Golf Union, now Scottish Golf, said: “What I’ve always felt is that you always have to look after the people who are your customers and maybe it was a case in golf when clubs had long waiting lists that they were too relaxed and didn’t feel as though they should be worried about the future.” This was a polite way of saying that many clubs facing closure were the authors of their own downfall. The decades of unchecked and widespread discrimination fostered a small-town sense of entitlement. Even as Scottish society began to change, these places seemed to provide a haven for old prejudices. “If fairness and equality are threatening your world then come here for comfort and reassurance,” they seemed to say. However, the harrowing of Scotland’s club golf terrain may yet provide some welcome benefits for the country. No other sport or pastime offers exercise and relaxation in spectacular settings to so many people at every stage of their lives. If you live to be 90 you can derive joy from this game until your dying breath. It is a pillar of Scotland’s tourism industry and is too important to fail. Scottish Golf, which fosters the game at club level, has worked hard to recalibrate it and help clubs make the transition from the old models of presumptive negligence to something more flexible and sustainable. These changes have been too late for some clubs, but others that are well run and have embraced change may reap the benefit of new members from failing clubs. Despite my many and varied failings at this game, both my sons have become tournament-winning scratch amateur golfers. They have different and more realistic perspectives. They feel that clubs are better structured and are much more friendly and welcoming to young people, including women and girls. Changing roles within families have also had an effect. The old model of a working man spending entire weekends on the golf course with his drinking chums is dying. Most clubs offer free memberships to juniors and equipment is much cheaper and can be hired. Scotland always had too many golf clubs and when times were good they willingly associated themselves with insidious parochial prejudice and elitism. Few will mourn the passing of some. Golf will continue to thrive in Scotland, but now this might include those clubs whose parents were once told they weren’t welcome. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/27/youtube-to-adjust-uk-algorithm-to-cut-false-and-extremist-content,"Views via recommendations of such ‘borderline’ videos were halved in similar US trial Alex Hern Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.30 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 18.32 BST YouTube is experimenting with an algorithm change to reduce the spread of what it calls “borderline content” in the UK, after a similar trial in the US resulted in a substantial drop in views. According to the video sharing site’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, the move is intended to give quality content “more of a chance to shine” and has the effect of reducing views from recommendations by 50%. YouTube has long taken action against content that violates the site’s policies, removing infringing videos and issuing “strikes” against creators that can ultimately result in them being blocked from uploading new videos. But only recently has the company moved against content that, in Wojcicki’s words, “brushes right up against our policy line”. This sort of content is the bedrock of the fear that YouTube is a driver of extremist views worldwide: the combination of borderline content and a recommendation algorithm that rewards the most engaging content can, critics argue, cause audiences to spiral towards more radical viewing. YouTube first took action against borderline content in the US earlier this year, and focused on videos that “could misinform users in harmful ways – such as videos promoting a phoney miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11”. After six months of the trial, the company says that views from recommendations to this sort of content fell by half. As a result, it is extending the trial to the UK, Ireland, South Africa “and other English-language markets”, Wojcicki said. Reducing the spread of borderline content is one of the “four Rs” that Wojcicki says underpins the company’s approach to stewardship of its community. In her quarterly letter to the site’s creators, the chief executive said the other three principles were: To “remove content that violates our policy as quickly as possible … and we’re always looking to make our policies clearer and more effective, as we’ve done with pranks and challenges, child safety and hate speech just this year”. To “raise up authoritative voices when people are looking for breaking news and information, especially during breaking news moments”. And to “set a higher bar for what channels can make money on our site, rewarding trusted, eligible creators. Not all content allowed on YouTube is going to match what advertisers feel is suitable for their brand; we have to be sure they are comfortable with where their ads appear”. “A commitment to openness is not easy,” Wojcicki added. “It sometimes means leaving up content that is outside the mainstream, controversial or even offensive. But I believe that hearing a broad range of perspectives ultimately makes us a stronger and more informed society, even if we disagree with some of those views.” In an interview with the Observer earlier this month, Wojcicki argued that “news or news commentary [is] a very small percentage of the number of views we have. The vast majority of YouTube is a combination of influencers who are focused in areas like comedy, beauty, how-to, gaming”. Problematic content, she said, “is an extremely small part of the platform”."
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/27/how-to-be-an-antiracist-ibram-x-kendi-review-racism-antiracism,"Colin Grant Tue 27 Aug 2019 07.00 BST I once considered outing a manager at work as a racist. I hesitated from the discomfort of embarking on such action, an unwillingness to fall into the category of victim, and because of the potentially serious consequences for the manager to be so labelled. I also knew that it was near impossible to prove; the racism was covert, though obvious to me. But in the end, I pulled back for a more prosaic reason: I realised that the boss to whom I’d have to report my assessment was more obviously racist than the offending manager. It’s a mark of the transformative and unsettling power of Ibram X Kendi’s writing that I relaxed into How to Be an Antiracist with the comforting and self-righteous knowledge that the title was not addressing me. After all I am black; I couldn’t possibly be racist, could I? By the book’s end, I wasn’t so sure. Donald Trump has made the assertion repeatedly that he is the “least racist person in the world”. But Kendi, the founding director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University in Washington, DC, argues that a minimum requirement for claiming antiracist bona fides is not to deny that which is palpably true. He highlights how Trump and his enablers have often countered criticism with “the white-supremacist idea that calling something racist is the primary form of racism”. How to Be an Antiracist offers a way out from the tangled disingenuousness of mainstream narratives around racism. Whether you’re an institution such as the BBC, fumbling editorially in determinedly refusing to describe Trump as a racist, or an individual in moral paralysis, dumbfounded by the febrile emotions now at large in a resurgence of racist attitudes, you are not alone; hope is on its way. At its simplest, the book argues that to be an antiracist is to take an active and persistent stance against racism. In Kendi’s conception, words and phrases that obscure the offence – unconscious bias, microaggressions and others – should make way for clearer-eyed definitions. Rather than institutionalised racism, which always takes some unpacking from the abstract, let’s call out the active ingredient: racist policy. Kendi believes that “we become unconscious to racist policymakers and policies as we lash out angrily at the abstract bogeyman of the ‘system’”. Kendi places himself at the centre of the argument, exploring how black people have also been seduced by racist ideology But it’s not just white people whose prejudicial thoughts and actions have been affected by racism. Kendi places himself front and centre of the argument, exploring how black people, too, have been seduced by racist ideology, owning up to his misguided adoption as a youth of the “virtuous/reprehensible black man” dichotomy, in which he distanced himself from those African Americans considered to be unworthy and guilty of letting down the race. The teenage Kendi avoids stepping on the “kicks” (trainers) of other black boys “like they were landmines”. Fed on noxious mainstream media tropes and propaganda about “ghetto blacks” and the “growing army of super-predators”, he describes being “stalked inside my head by racist ideas”. Poor racist whites have also been “played” by the establishment, buoyed, writes Kendi, by the notion that “I may not be rich, but at least I am not black”. In the 1960s, US president Lyndon B Johnson expanded on that pitiable belief: “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best coloured man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.” Writing calmly but insightfully in a series of brisk chapters, Kendi teases out the evolution of racism – from its historical underpinning and providing cover for the “civilising mission” of slavery and colonisation, through to the present, so-called “academic achievement gap” between black and white students, and the allegedly neutral standardised tests that serve as “the linchpin of a racist idea of behavioural racism”. Ultimately, racism is not the product of hatred and ignorance but, rather, the design of “racist power [to exploit] out of raw self-interest”, Kendi asserts. He cites cynical voter registration suppression techniques as a clear example in the 2000 presidential election of George W Bush, which was determined by the disqualification of thousands of votes from black people in Florida. In the course of How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi moves from his rigid framework and selective perception of the inequalities endured by black people as primarily explained through the prism of race; he’s increasingly inclined towards the view held by Martin Luther King Jr – espoused in his Poor People’s Campaign – of the intersection of racism with capitalism. Further, to be an antiracist is to challenge spurious (if perhaps well-intentioned) notions such as the “culture of poverty”, which allegedly traps impoverished black people in dependency – in opposition to, and ignorant of, the “culture of work”. “We can’t let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn’t a racist,” said the African American senator Cory Booker in the aftermath of the mass shootings in the US cities of Dayton and El Paso. Booker spoke movingly of this “moral moment” at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, where four years ago a white supremacist shot and killed several of the congregation. Echoing Kendi’s call to action, he argued: “If the answer to the question ‘Do racism and white supremacy exist?’ is yes, then the real question isn’t who is or isn’t a racist, but who is and isn’t doing something about it?” This vital book asks those same age-old questions: When does silence become complicity? Why do we fear taking action more than the devastating consequences of inaction? Kendi’s writing is a search for a language to enable the antiracist that resides in all of us. Towards the end, the 37-year-old scholar draws on the analogy of fighting the colon cancer that has threatened his own young life. How to Be an Antiracist encourages self-reflection on the compelling truth: “Racism has always been terminal and curable.” This review is from the Observer • How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X Kendi is published by Bodley Head (£16.99).

There are other similar schemes, such as Sydenham Garden in south London, which takes GP referrals for its therapeutic sessions. “Research shows that outdoor exercise or ‘ecotherapy’, such as gardening or walking, has huge benefits for wellbeing and can even be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety,” says Aimee Gee from the mental health charity Mind. “This is thought to be due to a combination of doing more physical activity, which is known to have many physical and mental health benefits; getting more regular social contact with people, which can reduce loneliness and boost self-esteem; and being surrounded by nature, which can boost your overall mood and sense of wellbeing.” The colours, sounds and smells of a garden, she says, “boost our wellbeing, while nurturing a garden or allotment provides the satisfaction of completing tasks and a stronger connection with the natural environment, both of which are associated with improved self-esteem and decreased levels of anger”. Monty Don, the gardener and TV presenter, has credited gardening with helping with the depression he has experienced. In a column for Gardeners’ World earlier this year, he summed up the optimism gardening instils: “When you plant something, you invest in a beautiful future amid a stressful, chaotic and, at times, downright appalling world.” Even if that doesn’t convince you of the magic of gardening, there is a strong possibility that other forms of non-clinical “social prescribing” might be on their way to your surgery soon; other alternative treatments include arts and crafts, walking and singing lessons."
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/26/klinefelter-syndrome-many-men-have-an-extra-x-chromosome-but-it-is-rarely-diagnosed,"Ammar Kalia Mon 26 Aug 2019 10.59 BST Three years ago, Paul (not his real name), now 31, went to the doctor with stomach pains. His blood test came back with low testosterone levels. “We went to see a urologist and he said bluntly that we wouldn’t have any options to have kids with my sperm – we would have to use a donor or adopt,” he says. “My wife immediately burst into tears.” The couple had been trying for a child since they married in 2015. Paul was also devastated. “It put so much stress on me, because I thought I couldn’t give my wife or my family what they so desperately wanted.” Eventually, Paul was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. Affecting about one in 600 men, it is one of the most common genetic conditions in the UK, yet most people have never heard of it – including many who have it. Its symptoms – extra height, persistent tiredness, reduced bodily hair and small testes – can be difficult to identify, meaning it often goes unnoticed by patients and GPs. Untreated, however, it can lead to reduced testosterone and infertility, and even increased prevalence of testicular cancer. The non-hereditary syndrome was first discovered in 1942. It is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome, resulting in XXY, as opposed to XY. With only one in six men who have Klinefelter’s ever diagnosed, even though symptoms often emerge during puberty, it may be one of the leading unexplored causes of infertility. Now, the first clinic in the UK to deal solely with Klinefelter’s has opened at Guy’s hospital in London – and its clinicians believe it could revolutionise its treatment and diagnosis. “By the time the Klinefelter’s patients get to us, they’re pretty much wrecks, since it can take up to two years to get the diagnosis,” says the urologist Tet Yap, who founded the clinic. The wait time is so long because patients are often referred by their GP (or, in some cases, by an infertility clinic) to a urologist and then an endocrinologist. Yap’s clinic is a “one-stop shop”, where patients can be seen by all the relevant specialists in one appointment. “Most men are only diagnosed when they struggle to conceive,” Yap says. “This will be when they are in their 30s or older. And then they are often told they are totally infertile, which can be false information and devastating to receive.” The new clinic has genetic counsellors and psychosexual experts on hand to help patients come to terms with the potentially bad news and to plan the next steps for treatment. “The process of diagnosis and then treatment is exhausting. I really feel for these guys spending so long not knowing what’s wrong with them,” Yap says. “A lot of them are told they’re just making up their symptoms.” After the crushing assessment by the urologist, Paul and his wife went to a private fertility clinic, which eventually referred him to Yap. The process took 18 months, even with private investment. If men wish to pursue fertility treatment, the NHS currently funds it only through a female partner, which many clinicians feel is anachronistic and potentially damaging. “Partner fertility reduces with age. Normally by the time the men have been diagnosed, most of their partners have crossed the age limit for IVF funding, so it’s very frustrating for them,” says Yap. “They will have been on the pathway for two or three years, then finally get told: ‘Sorry, your partner doesn’t have access to funding.’” Yap told Paul and his wife that they had a chance of conceiving themselves: Paul would need to start testosterone, then undergo a relatively new surgical procedure called microTESE – microsurgical testicular sperm extraction – by which sperm is extracted from the testes’ tubules. Paul has since had one, unsuccessful, round of IVF through microTESE, with another scheduled for March. “Because we were told ‘no’ right at the beginning, this opportunity is such a bonus. It wouldn’t happen without Yap and the clinic being here to put to rest all the uncertainty I was feeling for those 18 months.” He now volunteers at the clinic as a patient liaison, helping those with new diagnoses understand their options. “We need to encourage a greater awareness among GPs and men to get early diagnoses, because if you only find out when you want to have kids, like I did, then waiting years for treatment can feel like a lifetime.” There’s a stigma around Klinefelter’s ... many people won’t disclose they have it, which means they don’t get support Paul credits his wife’s support for enabling him to persist with the treatment; others have been less fortunate. Raj Baksi, 46, found out he has Klinefelter’s a decade ago when he was trying for a child with his wife. After an unsuccessful microTESE operation, his relationship broke down. “Infertility can change everything,” he says. Baksi has since become involved with the Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association and runs Facebook support groups for affected men from across the globe. “There’s a stigma around Klinefelter’s: some people’s families are really unsupportive, their friends can be embarrassed, and even some employers can see you differently. Many people won’t publicly disclose they have it, which means they don’t get the support they need.” Alison Bridges, the chair of the Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association, says this is one of the reasons why the condition is largely unrecognised. “GPs think it’s rarer than it is, but it’s not rare – it’s just rarely diagnosed,” she says. “There is a lack of awareness, since men often don’t come forward, even if they are diagnosed, so we want to get them together to at least feel they are not alone in this.” The association has been running weekend camps for men with Klinefelter’s for the past 19 years, to encourage them to talk to each other. “Klinefelter’s men can often find it difficult to express themselves emotionally, as one of their symptoms,” says Bridges. “But on these weekends away we’ve seen huge changes in their outlook, from despair to hope.” Leila Frodsham, a psychosexual specialist, works at the clinic to help men with Klinefelter’s gain the confidence to address their condition, as well as to help increase their chances of conceiving. “With Klinefelter’s, we might replace men’s testosterone or give them pills to perform better sexually, but then they still have an overriding anxiety that makes it difficult to have sex,” she says. “When sex becomes more about procreation than pleasure, it causes all sorts of problems, so I act as a voice for my patients, so they feel they can overcome this situation.” Charlotte Tomlinson, a genetic counsellor, says diagnosed men and their partners also need to prepare for the possibility of infertility, even after treatment. “The diagnosis is a huge challenge to masculine identity, especially if you’re trying for a child at the same time,” she says. “A lot of my work is broaching the subject of how to cope with the loss if the treatment doesn’t work.” With success rates for sperm retrieval at only 10%, there is a high likelihood of this being the case. Clinicians emphasise that early intervention is key if men with Klinefelter’s want to reduce their symptoms and increase their chances of fertility. “If we can retrieve sperm at an early age, these men wouldn’t have to go down the path of surgery and infertility later, when there is more pressure on them,” says Yap. “That means perhaps screening young men and, above all, educating them on the symptoms to look out for.” Henry Mitchell, 30, attended the first clinic Yap ran, in April, and has since had a successful microTESE operation to freeze his sperm for the future. “It was a huge relief that they could find sperm,” he says. “I’m lucky I found out early, because it could’ve been when I wanted kids and then it would’ve been a much lengthier and harder process. This has given me a safety net for the future.” The clinic has limited capacity, but with all 10 slots for October filled and a growing waiting list, Yap believes it will only grow. “We’re already getting people coming from all over the country and even requests from abroad. Having all these specialists in one place also means we can develop new research and methods of better administering testosterone. These men and their partners shouldn’t have to live in such uncertainty.”"

The food was simple but delicious, and this was a dish that really hit the spot after a long day of walking. We recreated it in our campervan later on in the holiday with some crispy chorizo that we bought at a local market. It makes a fine midweek supper dish and an even better brunch after a wild night out. The fennel and chorizo add incredible depth of flavour to an otherwise very simple supper or lunch dish. Prep 15 minCook 50 minServes 4-6 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil100g chorizo, very thinly sliced1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced3 large garlic cloves, peeled, 2 finely sliced, 1 left whole for rubbing1 tsp ground fennel seeds1½ tsp sweet smoked paprika1 red pepper, cut in half, deseeded and cut into ½cm-wide slices1 green pepper, cut in half, deseeded and cut into ½cm-wide slices5 large and juicy tomatoes, cut into rough 1cm cubes3 tbsp manzanilla sherrySalt and black pepper½ tsp soft brown sugar4-6 eggsSourdough bread, to serve Warm half the oil in a large frying pan (ideally with a lid) over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chorizo and fry for a few minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Keeping the fat in the pan, add the onion and cook for 10 minutes, until it is beginning to soften. Add the sliced garlic, fennel seeds and paprika and cook for a few more minutes, then stir in the peppers, tomatoes and sherry. Season well with salt and pepper, add the sugar and cook, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, until you have a lovely, chunky sauce. Turn the heat down to medium-low, make four to six indents in the sauce and crack in the eggs. Season again, and either cover and cook on the hob or pop into a medium oven for about eight minutes, until the whites are just set (you can also do this under a grill). Take off the heat, spoon into bowls and scatter with the crisp chorizo. Serve with chargrilled slices of sourdough bread, rubbed with the whole garlic clove and drizzled with the remaining extra-virgin olive oil. Make double the quantity of sauce and keep some back in the fridge or freezer. It is great with sausages and lamb chops. Alternatively, try baking it with cubes of feta and lots of chopped oregano for an exceedingly good sauce for brown rice, or use it to top a pizza with black olives and more of that crispy chorizo."

17:52 The pound’s strength held the London stock market back today. The FTSE 100 closed 5 points lower at 7,089, while other European indices posted gains. Germany’s DAX rose by 71 points to 11,730, up 0.6%. 2.48pm BST
14:48 Fiona Cincotta at City Index agrees that no-deal Brexit fears are easing today, pushing the pound up (a bit). She writes: Sterling is advancing across the board as the UK opposition leaders met today to plot to prevent a no deal Brexit. Whilst Bojo is sticking to his do or die Brexit mantra, he has also expressed a little more optimism that a new deal can still be achieved between the EU and the UK. This comes following last week’s visits to Germany and France where Angela Merkel and French President Macron both said they are willing to listen to alternatives the Irish backstop. Pound traders are interpreting recent developments as a slight easing back from the brink of a no deal Brexit, and so it is advancing. 2.45pm BST
14:45 Merger news: Philip Morris has announced it is talking to fellow tobacco firm Altria over a possible takeover. It’s billed as a ‘merger of equals’, but the deal has pushed Altria up almost 10% at the open while Philip Morris stock is down about 3%. Philip Morris says: “There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these discussions.” Rumours of a possible tie-up have been swirling recently, as the tobacco industry faces the decline of traditional cigarettes -- with Philip Morris backing smoke-free electronic cigarette brand iQOS. If the deal goes through, it would reunite Philip Morris International and Altria more than a decade after the two companies split. Altria is focused on the US, while PMI selss overseas.

14:27 In the currency markets, sterling has gained three-quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.23 -- a one-month high. It’s up against the euro too at €1.107, which is also the level since the end of July. The rally comes as opposition leaders agreed to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and oppose any efforts to shut parliament down. Following a meeting in London, the Labour party, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green party and the Independent Group for Change issued this statement: The leaders of the opposition parties held a productive and detailed meeting on stopping a disastrous no-deal exit from the EU. Jeremy Corbyn outlined the legal advice he has received from shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, which calls Boris Johnson’s plans to suspend parliament to force through a no deal “the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory”. The attendees agreed that Boris Johnson has shown himself open to using anti-democratic means to force through no deal. The attendees agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence. The party leaders agreed to further meetings. Yesterday, prime minister Boris Johnson said he was “marginally more optimistic” about reaching a new deal with the EU. However, that would require a solution to the Irish backstop issue. Otherwise, Johnson insists Britain would leave on 31st October without a deal. Our Politics Live blog has more details: 1.47pm BST
13:47 Hopes of a trade war breakthrough have pushed the oil price up too, with Brent crude gaining 0.6% to $59 per barrel. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, advises caution....: “At the start of this week, investor sentiment turned around completely on reports that US-China trade talks are to be restarted and that there might be a US-Iran Summit – though this seems contingent on dropping sanctions. But beware! Sentiment can clearly change on a tweet. If investors believe that the US-China trade dispute is part of a longer-term hegemonic battle between the US and China, then they likely assume the trade dispute will carry on for much longer without a satisfactory resolution.” 1.36pm BST

13:15 In an interesting twist, Beijing has announced it is considering measures designed to stimulate its economy, and counter the damage caused by the trade war. Beijing’s State Council has identified 20 measures to support consumption, including removing the restrictions on auto sales that are imposed by some local governments. That could stimulate demand for new cars - where sales have fallen steadily for the last year. The Council also announced that it could: These measures could support growth, which fell to a 27-year low of 6.2% per year in the last quarter.

11:33 Italy’s Democratic Party have confirmed that coalition talks with M5S have hit a roadblock, but they’re not taking the blame. They say it’s M5S’s fault, for insisting that their leader, Luigi Di Maio, should become interior minister as well as deputy PM. M5S have denied it, though. The interior ministry’s job had been held by Matteo Salvini, head of the League party, so it’s now up for grabs following the end of the League-M5S coalition. 10.20am BST
10:20 Over in Italy, talks to form a new coalition government are on hold. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has suspended negotiations with the centre-left Democratic Party (DP), until they agree to the reappointment of Giuseppe Conte as prime minister. In a statement, M5S say “nothing was achieved” in yesterday’s talks, adding: “We cannot any longer work like this. Either the attitude changes or it’s difficult. We will see the PD again when the party has given its OK to the reappointment of Conte.” Conte resigned last week after M5S’s previous coalition partners, the right-wing League, quit. Despite M5S’s move, investors are still hopeful that a deal will be reached with DP to avoid new elections. The Italian stock market has jumped by 1% today, up 192 points at 20,869. The negotiation on a new government between center-left PD and 5 Star Movement that yesterday seemed at hand is now stuck: the two parties cannot agree on who is going to be the next Prime Minister. They still have 24 hours to sort out their differences The reason is that the president of the Republic gave the parties untill Wednsday to find a solution to the crisis.

09:38 The trade war has certainly left its mark on Germany’s economy. Updated GDP figures, released this morning, confirm that German GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Net trade dragged growth back, as the new US-China tariffs hurt demand for German-made goods. German exports slumped by 1.3% during the quarter. Imports fell by 0.3%. Construction investment also fell, but household spending rose slightly (+0.1%) while government spending increased by 0.5%. Destatis, the Federal Statistical Office, says that “Germany experienced a slight decline in economic performance” in Q2. The big question is whether Germany is falling into recession. Yesterday, we learned that German business confidence has hit a six-year low, as bosses grow more pessimistic about their economic prospects. 9.18am BST
09:18 China’s central bank is doing its best to prop up the yuan, as it sinks to fresh 11-year lows today. CNBC has the details: China fixed the daily midpoint rate for the yuan at levels not seen for more than a decade on Tuesday as Beijing remains locked in a protracted trade war with Washington. The People’s Bank of China set the midpoint at 7.0810 per dollar — weaker than the previous day’s fix, but stronger than the 7.1055 level the market was expecting, according to a Reuters estimate. By setting the yuan midpoint at a level stronger than expected, China could be signalling to the markets that it may want to slow down the pace of the currency’s depreciation, Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at Singapore’s OCBC Bank, told CNBC. “Although China has been more open minded about its currency regime,” Xie said by email. While Beijing is giving markets a “bigger role to decide (on) the currency, China still monitors the pace of movement carefully,” he added.

Healthcare stocks, consumer cyclicals and industrial firms are among the fallers. This is the Footsie’s lowest level in nearly two weeks, when recession fears drove it down to a six-month low. Other European markets are also a little lower, with Germany’s DAX down 0.3%. 8.38am BST
08:38 Now this is awkward. Beijing is refusing to confirm Donald Trump’s claim that Chinese officials called “twice” over the weekend to discuss trade talks with his administration. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang has been asked about Trump’s comments at the G7 meeting, and he’s insisted that he’s not heard of any recent telephone call between the United States and China on trade. China's Foreign Ministry says they have not heard of telephone call between the US and China on trade Geng added that he hopes Washington can stop its wrong actions and create conditions for talks. 8.19am BST
08:19 Swiss bank UBS is so concerned about the trade war that it is recommending that its clients sell shares. UBS has cut its recommendation on equities to “underweight”, for the first time since the eurozone crisis in 2012. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS’s wealth management group, told clients that the risk of a deeper trade war was growing -- so they should ditch some equites now. He wrote: The trade dispute escalated this weekend, with the US president saying the conflict was “in many ways…an emergency.” Late last week, the US and China both announced a fresh increase in tariffs on each other’s goods, including an increase to 30% from 25% on $250bn of US imports of Chinese products. We still believe the US can avoid recession in 2020, helped by easing from the Federal Reserve and healthy consumer spending. But downside risks are increasing for both the global economy and markets. With talks between the US and China dominating market moves over the near term, investors should brace for higher volatility. We believe it is prudent to take action to neutralize part of this event risk, pending greater clarity on the political outlook. As a result, we are reducing risk in our portfolios, moving to an underweight in equities to lower our exposure to political uncertainty. Updated

07:59 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a welcome long weekend break, City investors are returning to their desks...and returning to worrying about the US-China trade war. Overnight, China’s yuan has sunk to a new 11 and a half-year low, on worries that its economy is suffering from the ongoing dispute with Washington. It has hit 7.16 yuan to the dollar in the onshore market for the first time since 2008. The yuan has now lost more than 3% this month, as the trade conflict has escalated. These latest losses come after America and China confirmed they would impose new tit-for-tat tariffs next month. China is imposing duties between 5% and 10% on more than 5,000 US products including agricultural goods, aircraft and crude oil. This prompted America to hike its tariffs on many Chinese goods from 25% to 30%. It’s new tariffs, on $300bn of Chinese imports, will now be levied at 15% rather than 10%. #China Yuan keeps falling as traders temper optimism over U.S.-China trade deal. pic.twitter.com/rzSwgNFU56 The yuan’s weakness will help Chinese companies compete abroad, and offset some of the impact of America’s tariffs. But some economists believe China is actually trying to support the yuan, having allowed it to fall through the 7-level three weeks ago. President Trump spooked global markets on Friday, when he demanded that US companies should repatriate their operations from China. But there are also signs that we could yet see a reconciliation between the two sides. During yesterday’s G7 meeting, Trump claimed that China had called asking to restart negotiations, declaring: “I have great respect for the fact that China called, they want to make a deal. “This is the first time I’ve seen them where they really do want to make a deal, and I think that’s a very positive step. Curiously, Beijing officials had no recollection of picking up the phone, but Trump’s comments were enough to push Wall Street higher yesterday. The Dow gained around 1%, having shed around 2% during Friday’s panicky rout. Here’s how wildly stocks swing when Trump mentions the trade war https://t.co/qN8bxKRQlc pic.twitter.com/QNz7wtGv2P Asia-Pacific markets are also calmer today, after suffering a sharp tumble on Monday. Yesterday, China’s vice-president Liu He told a state-controlled newspaper that Beiojing wants to resolve the dispute “through calm negotiations and resolutely opposes the escalation of the conflict.” Some calm would certainly be welcome in the City today, where traders are also watching out for new UK and US housing data. They’ll also keep an eye on Italy, where efforts to form a new coalition government are ongoing. Updated

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 00.05 BST Internazionale have finally reached a deal to sign Alexis Sánchez on a loan from Manchester United. The two clubs have been discussing a possible deal for several weeks now and a breakthrough in negotiations day saw the reaching of an agreement. Sánchez’s loan is believed to be for 10 months and Inter do not have an option to buy, although the Serie A club will pay £175,000 of Sanchez’s £390,000 weekly salary. The 30-year-old will have his medical in Milan on Wednesday. Sánchez joined United as part of the deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan sign for Arsenal in January 2018 but he has failed to make any impact at Old Trafford. The Chile international scored only three goals in 32 league appearances and the Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, has been keen to offload him despite having already sold Romelu Lukaku to Inter. The move will leave Solskjær short up front. The Norwegian now has only Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood as his available forwards and Martial is currently struggling with a thigh injury. United started the season with a 4-0 win over Chelsea but then drew against Wolverhampton Wanderers away before losing at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday. They play Southampton away this coming Saturday."

Last modified on Fri 16 Aug 2019 18.11 BST It’s Friday night, and it’s been a long day. You’re a young woman walking into a bar, looking for your friends, when a man you don’t know walks up to you, grabs you, and pulls you close. “SPIN,” he says intensely, turning you in a circle. It’s a command, not a request. When you try to pull away, he feigns sadness for a moment, furrowing his brow, and then declares his love for you, a look of pain in his eyes. “Don’t embarrass me,” the man growls, and tries to pull you towards the door, toward a cab, towards his apartment, even as you resist. Welcome to The Game: The Game, where a dating sim is transformed into survival horror by filtering “romance” through the lens of “pick-up artists”, a lucrative but emotionally deformed community where poorly adjusted and manipulative men teach others how to extract sex from women at all costs. In a traditional dating sim, you’d be presented with a variety of romantic interests, and encouraged to choose the one you like the most. In The Game, as in pick-up artistry at large, it’s not about what you want; instead, you’re presented with several men willing to do a wide range of things to get you into bed, each of them based on a real-life leader in the seduction community, and tailored to his specific approach. Created by artist and academic Angela Washko, The Game: The Game drops you smack dab in the middle of numerous highly regimented “seduction” routines, designed to leave you off-balance and less likely to push back against your would-be seducer, as he plays on your insecurities and makes you feel like saying “no” is irrational. Washko became interested in pick-up artists through her work within the massively multiplayer roleplaying game World of Warcraft, where she facilitated discussions about the poor treatment of female players and how to make the community more welcoming for all. Some of the men she spoke to mentioned pick-up artist books – particularly those by Roosh V (AKA Daryush Valizadeh). The author of books including Bang Iceland, Bang Poland and Bang Ukraine, which offer advice for men on how to procure sex in various countries through manipulative tactics, Valizadeh once advocated for the legalisation of rape on private property, saying it would make women protect themselves better and be more “responsible” for their behaviour. He later claimed the post was satire, though his books graphically detail situations in which he describes having sex with women who were too intoxicated to consent, unconscious, crying or saying no. “No means no – until it means yes,” wrote Valizadeh. (He has since found God while on mushrooms and, ironically, banned all discussion of casual sex from his forums.) After examining the texts and practices of the “seduction community,” Washko decided to embark on a deep dive, acquiring the sometimes expensive primary materials and texts of their various systems and mapping their differences. Every quote or interaction you have in The Game with a particular “leader” is drawn directly from their coaching videos, guide books or other primary materials. Some exchanges are recreated word for word. Simply by asking the player to experience them from the point of view of the woman rather than the man, these techniques are instantly transformed from seductive into something more like a nightmare. If these seduction tactics, which seem designed to achieve consent through persistence and manipulation, seem shocking and disturbing to those only casually aware of the PUA community, Washko says that’s because the most extreme tactics advocated by the scene’s figureheads are typically only visible to those willing to pay hundreds of dollars for their videos, or thousands of dollars for a seminar. “You’re not going to see the bulk of their coaching content for free,” says Washko. “But after purchasing those materials and watching the primary coaching videos, they were extraordinarily disturbing and incriminating … There’s a shocking amount of behaviour that disregards consent. It’s incredible that these videos have managed to circulate without the degree of scrutiny that they should have, and I think it’s largely because of the paywall.” As a genre, dating simulators provide a particularly resonant space to explore a transactional view of sex and dating. In most dating sims, the player is presented with a roster of romantic interests, and must tailor their actions or dialogue choices to gain positive responses from their target and win their bodies or hearts. Say or do the right thing, acquire enough points, and you will get what you came for, whether it is sex or love. This is, self-evidently, not how real life works: games are designed to be won through skill and persistence, whereas human beings are not preprogrammed to satisfy the desires of a random individual who finds them attractive. But Washko says that many leading pickup artists “use video game metaphors for talking about seduction. They break it down to different levels where this or that occurs … and terminology like ‘cracking the code’.” When she interviewed Valizadeh, he described how, if you reach a certain point in the seduction and offend the woman, “You have to actually do a reset. There’s definitely a sense that you just have to put in a certain amount of time and moves in order to get to the next level … and eventually you get what you came for.” Perceiving any woman as “winnable”, if only sufficient time and coercion are applied – like sexual treasure chests that will always open if you enter the right code or use enough psychological force – is not only dehumanising but dangerous. In this framework, no is not “no”, but rather just another obstacle to be overcome by working on various pressure points of insecurity, humiliation and psychological coercion. After all, if a woman simply isn’t interested in a man who has targeted her for “seduction” – or is even repelled and frightened by him – what does it mean for him to “beat the game” if not pushing her to do something she doesn’t want to do? The Game: The Game is paired with a tense, minimalist soundtrack by the experimental band Xiu Xiu that evokes a sense of claustrophobia and tacit threat. As various men try to back you into corners, manipulate your body, force you into situations where what you want is of no importance, the music sings with the terror of a clenched muscle. Washko has played The Game: The Game with numerous testers, and says that some of the most compelling responses have come from men, who come away from the experience saying: “This is a horror game. This is a nightmare. This is terrifying.” Women often had a different perspective, says Washko: “This is my life. This is every day.” The Game: The Game can be downloaded here."

But Austen herself wouldn’t have batted an eyelid Alex von Tunzelmann Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.27 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.31 BST ITV’s new Jane Austen adaptation, Sanditon, made a splash at the seaside this week. While the female characters used a bathing machine to change into long red Handmaid’s Tale-style smocks before taking to the waters, the men stripped off and plunged in. ITV stopped short of showing anything frontal, but more refined viewers may have found themselves reaching for the smelling salts as naked male rumps filled the screen. Bottoms in Austen! Whatever next? Let’s hope there were some smelling salts left, for next was a scene that hinted at a handjob. Anne Reid, who plays Lady Denham on the show, expressed dismay (with tongue in cheek): “It’s the times we live in,” she told the Radio Times: “There are a lot of naked males around and I think it’s unnecessary.” The screenwriter Andrew Davies, who also wrote the hugely influential 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, said that his wife wanted him to show more male nudity to balance out the ubiquitous female nudity on TV: “I thought it looked so beautiful,” he said. The unfinished novel on which Sanditon is based was written in 1817. By then, spas such as Bath obliged male patrons to wear a bathing garment. But there was no such provision at the seaside, in rivers or in lakes, where men would simply disrobe. When Davies had Mr Darcy (Colin Firth) dip in a pond in Pride and Prejudice – a television moment that did more to bring Austen’s work to a new generation than any school curriculum – it was absurd that he failed to remove his shirt and breeches. As Andrea Richards of the Jane Austen Society of Melbourne noted: “In the interests of historical accuracy, we should have seen much more of Colin Firth – his wet shirt scene should have been a nude scene.” Eric Chaline, the author of Strokes of Genius: A History of Swimming, has noted that “possibly the first reference to practical male swimwear in Europe” was in a German gymnastics guide published in 1793, which recommended “linen drawers, reaching halfway down the thigh”. These did not immediately catch on, although swimming trunks became popular in the 20th century. Only in the 1860s did British men routinely begin to wear bathing suits of any kind. Although some women probably swam naked in Austen’s time, too, flannel chemises or elaborate bathing dresses were considered appropriate and were often provided along with rentable bathing machines. It is a mistake to project our modern prudishness back on to the past: to assume that, because some social customs appear more conservative than ours, everything must have been. Austen was a contemporary of artists Thomas Rowlandson and JMW Turner, some of whose works are still considered shockingly licentious. Her world was not as buttoned-up as we might imagine. Of course, the naked bottoms in Sanditon are there because ITV wants you to watch the show – but there is no reason to presume that Austen herself would have raised an eyebrow. And that handjob? Admittedly, it is a bit of an advance on the intimate scene of two characters “closely engaged in gentle conversation” Austen describes. Still, if you prefer that, you can always read the book."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 18.55 BST Beryl Burton had a simple motto. “Anything lads can do,” she told herself, “I can do.” And then she got on her bike and showed the world the truth of her assertion through achievements that provided an early sign of what we now believe to be true: that in endurance events, whether cycling or open-water swimming or ultra-marathon running, the gap between men and women decreases as the distance grows. Between the ages of 19 and 39 the Yorkshirewoman won enough cups and medals to fill a house. They included two world road race championships, five world pursuit titles, 72 national time trial championships at distances from 10 to 100 miles, 12 national road race titles and a further dozen national pursuit titles. As a record breaker in time trials at all distances, she was beyond compare. Most of her national records lasted 20 years; one stood for half a century. When it came to showing she could compete with “lads”, one incident has entered into legend. In September 1967 she made the short journey from her home in Morley, south of Leeds, to take part in the 12-hour time trial run by Otley cycling club. She was 30, and at her peak. The male competitors were due to start first, at one-minute intervals, followed by the handful of women. Among the men, the final starter was Mike McNamara, who was on his way to the coveted title of best British all-rounder. During his description of the event in The Greatest, his biography of Burton, my colleague William Fotheringham records her list of the food she prepared for a ride that started just after seven o’clock in the morning and ended an hour before sunset: “fruit salad, peaches, rice pudding, fruit and honey cake, egg and milk, peppermint and blackcurrant, coffee, glucose, malt bread, bananas, four bits of steak and some cheese”. Most of this was loaded into the support car driven by her husband, Charlie, who, having introduced her to cycling when she was in her teens, acted throughout her career in a purely supporting role that not all men – particularly, perhaps, in the Yorkshire of 50 years ago – would find easy to accept. Burton’s list does not include what became perhaps the most famous bit of food – if you can call it that – in the history of British cycling. Having completed 235 miles, still with almost two hours to go, she overhauled McNamara, who had started two minutes ahead of her and had been trying to keep her at bay, which meant repressing an urgent need to pee. As she went past, in a rather ambiguous gesture of consolation, she passed him a Liquorice Allsort. At that point he finally gave in to the need to climb off and empty his bladder. Earlier in the day Burton had suffered a persistent stomach ache, relieved only when Charlie drove up alongside and offered her a nip of brandy. In the final hour she allowed McNamara to repass her and sat safely 100 yards or so behind him until the end of her 12 hours by which time she had covered 277.25 miles outdistancing McNamara by almost half a mile and setting a record for all-comers, men or women. A woman had beaten all the men in a major endurance event while competing against them in exactly the same conditions. The time trial was Burton’s thing and the only reason she never won the world time trial championship is that it wasn’t there to be won. By the time the governing body finally decided to allow women to race against the clock for a world title, her career was long over. It was the same with the Olympics: when women cyclists were finally admitted to the Games in 1984, she was 47 years old – although that did not prevent her from hoping vainly for a place in the British team. Beneath the image of a straightforward Yorkshire lass, Burton was a complicated person: strong willed and obsessively competitive. At 11, having just endured the blow of unexpectedly failing the exam that would have secured her a grammar school place, she had suffered severe complications from rheumatic fever, keeping her in hospital for nine months and convalescent for a further year. It was not until her new boyfriend got her on a bike that she found her means of self-expression, one that justified the years of maintaining her strength through hard toil on a rhubarb farm. The most moving and troubling passages of the book concern her relationship with her daughter, Denise, who followed her into cycling. On the day the 20-year-old beat her mother to win the national road race title in 1976, the pain of defeat was so strong that Beryl could not bring herself to congratulate her daughter. Six years later, however, they were sharing a British 10-mile tandem record. At the end of September the world’s best cyclists will gather in Yorkshire, competing for the women’s and men’s rainbow jerseys over roads Beryl Burton knew well. Having set an example that advanced the cause of women in sport, she died in 1996 while out on her bike delivering invitations to her 59th birthday party; the heart attack that killed her may have had its origins in her childhood illness. “She was well known but no one truly knew her,” Fotheringham writes; he is a knowledgeable and sympathetic storyteller but the reader is left with the feeling there are layers still waiting to be peeled away, if time has not sealed them permanently together. The Greatest: The Times and Life of Beryl Burton is published by YouCaxton (£20)."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.53 BST Calypso, soca, steelpan and the masquerade (mas) bands have been key elements of the Notting Hill carnival since it began in 1966. It wasn’t until 1973 that carnival architect Leslie Palmer officially invited stationary sound systems – first brought to the UK from Jamaica – to join the celebrations. and the event took on its noted street-party feel. Palmer wanted to attract a larger, younger crowd, because back then funding was directly linked to turnout. Still, Palmer probably wouldn’t have imagined that, almost 50 years later, carnival would feature more than 30 sound systems. Some have cult status, while others bring out new British talent to perform on the mic. Exiting Westbourne Park station, revellers are welcomed to Leamington Road Villas by the bass line of the Sir Lloyd sound system, which has been a carnival fixture for 40 years. Dedicated to classic carnival sounds that reach back four decades, Sir Lloyd attracts an eclectic mix of people. On a road nearby, Benji B’s colourful Deviation attracts a slightly younger crowd. Further into the carnival on Portobello Road is Gladdy Wax Roadshow, a reggae sound system that has been around even longer than Sir Lloyd’s. A don of the London reggae scene, Gladwin Wright’s system was a spinoff from Wax Unlimited record shop in Stoke Newington, which he ran for 14 years. The clouds of smoke floating up from the nearby barbecues, along with the older men skanking in the street with joints in hand to an impressive collection of reggae, seem to push Portobello Road back in time. Virgo International brings things closer to the present day: with its Vybz Kartel-heavy playlist, it proves to be one of the best spots away from the main parade to catch a whine as strangers find themselves pressed together thanks to the vast crowds. The cool corner of carnival is arguably around Colville Square and Colville Terrace, home to some of the best-dressed young carnival-goers. Not technically a sound system, the Inklusive Sound stage at Powis Square has a youthful edge, offering a solid serving of new afro bashment and dancehall, while around the corner Rampage is locked in one street with a similarly adventurous energy: artists including the godfather of grime, Wiley, along with Party Hard rapper Donae’o and dancehall singer Kranium grace the stage, inciting mosh pits as temperatures hit the 30s. People’s Sound, meanwhile, lives up to its name by giving the people what they want: ska pumps out of the speakers, slowing the movement of the sweating bodies. They still get people doing the electric slide, which is nothing short of a miracle given the heat – not to mention a fitting metaphor for Notting Hill carnival and the sound systems that are still a vision of unity 50-plus years on."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 07.53 BST When Aldwyn Roberts, better known as Lord Kitchener, stepped off the deck of the SS Windrush in 1948, he sang a few lines of his new song, London is the Place for Me. It’s been more than 70 years since that fateful moment, when hundreds of Caribbean Commonwealth citizens made the UK their home, but Roberts’s spirit and that of the Windrush generation could still be felt at Notting Hill carnival, Europe’s largest street festival. Michael Oliver, who goes by the name of Bubbles, dressed up as Roberts to honour his parents’ generation. He was carrying a briefcase with the word “Windrush” plastered on one side, while another famous Lord Kitchener lyric, “the road made to walk on carnival day”, was on the other side. The 68-year-old said: “You can never get rid of the template. This group of people played a great part in this whole thing. They came here and brought all their culture and we have enhanced the culture.” Oliver was keen for the carnival not to be taken out of its historical context. “It’s a celebration, but it’s a deep thing. It’s more than just coming out on the street and getting drunk.” London’s first carnival was held in 1959 in response to a series of racist attacks and rioting that spread from Nottingham to west London, where white youths went out targeting black people. The carnival was put together to celebrate the culture of the local community because, according to a brochure handed out during the time: “A people’s art is the genesis of their freedom.” Krysta Billong, who travelled from Paris, said: “It’s still about celebrating black people and our freedom.” The 30-year-old has come to the carnival regularly over the last decade. She was dancing on the Red Bull Music x Mangrove float with her friend Jeannine Fischer, a dance instructor. “We’re celebrating blackness, we’re celebrating Caribbean and Africans, and we do it in the sun, with good music and with some jerk chicken of course,” Billong said. They were part of more than 1 million people to descend on west London this bank holiday weekend to celebrate the two-day festival known for its mas bands, where themed costumes meet with music, steel pans and booming sound systems. Levi Roots turned to the Jamaican word brawta to describe the atmosphere at carnival on Monday. “It means the cherry on the top of the sweetness. Yesterday was the starter and today builds on that,” he said. Roots, 61, still remembers his very first carnival in 1976; he had just come to England from Jamaica. “It was my first experience where it was a place that was about Caribbean people. It was great to see Caribbean people in their essence doing what we love, sharing food and music,” he said. Roots said he was not surprised that carnival had morphed into Europe’s biggest street party. “We’ve been waiting for everyone to wake up to what’s been done here. Carnival should be taken as seriously as the Chelsea flower show and Glastonbury.” Roots made a name for himself selling his Reggae Reggae Sauce, first on a stall at carnival, then at all major retailers across the country. Roots said he was honoured to be on one of 10 Notting Hill carnival ambassadors. “It’s absolutely amazing. I started here, where it was just me trying to raise a few quid for my kids to buy trainers and now I get to represent what carnival is about,” he said. Edmond and his wife, Gene, were dressed as sailors to not only celebrate carnival, but also the 50th anniversary of Edmond moving to London. “They’ve used carnival to remind people of Windrush, who came here and brought carnival here. We grew up with this, it’s part of our nature and to see it develop has been amazing.” He laughed when asked if he loved or hated the city: “I can’t say I hate it but I can’t say love … let’s go with like.” Nicole got up at 6.30am and travelled with her aunt Leynoe from Hertfordshire to celebrate her 28th birthday. “I’ve come since I was four and I love the vibe and the music. It’s putting us in the limelight and reminds people that not everything should be negative when it comes to black people.” Leynoe said carnival was like a drug. “We’ve been doing it for years and years and years and we love every minute of it. I’ve become addicted,” she said. Mercedes Benson, 27, who was dancing as part of the Mangrove mas band, admitted she only had two hours’ sleep, but said it was not going to hold her back. “It’s carnival weekend, it doesn’t stop. It’s electric, it’s buzzing and full of laughter and love.” Roots was keen to give credit to the festival organisers, who he said were under immense pressure to either move the carnival or stop it all together. But Edmond, who lives round the corner from the festivities, is not too worried. “They’ve been trying to move carnival for 40 odd years and they haven’t succeeded. The bands are local and so are we. We’ll come out to the street every time.”"

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 00.41 BST When Professor Judith Grisel sat down to write her book Never Enough (a guide to the neuroscience of addiction that has been her life’s work), she didn’t expect to share so much of her own story. Nevertheless the resulting chapters are a collision of the personal and professional, detailing the deep links between her work life and the decade of drug and alcohol addiction that almost destroyed her. On paper, Grisel was an unlikely candidate for going off the rails. One of three children, she describes a privileged upbringing in a progressive, suburban area of New Jersey. With an airline pilot father and a mother who was a registered nurse, Grisel remembers growing up in a “perfect-looking family”. As her research would go on to help demonstrate, there was no single factor that predicted her drug problems. Neuroscientists have found a complex blend of nature and nurture at work in addictive tendencies and their research shows that many genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors work together in complex ways that often remain elusive. At just 13, I found alcohol. It was the first time I felt relaxed “Why me?” is the question that underpins much of Grisel’s research, and she continues to wonder why friends who drank heavily with her in high school were spared addiction. In Never Enough she offers a smorgasbord of theories behind her own and others’ predisposition to addiction: an “extreme” personality and love of risk-taking, trying drugs at a young age, lower levels of endorphins in the brain, potential hypersensitivity to the neurological rewards of drugs alongside, more surprisingly, her own parents’ strict response to her behaviour. “If they had just been a little more lax, if I hadn’t been the first child, I probably could have been normal,” she reflects. Grisel did not experience the childhood poverty, insecure housing or abuse we have come (rightly) to associate with some drug users’ histories. Instead she believes the misery within her parents’ relationship and the pressure she felt to keep up appearances had the greatest impact on her trajectory. “Their marriage was so dysfunctional that my mother eventually got an annulment from the Pope but we never acknowledged it at the time. As a kid I felt like a prop in this play of the perfect family.” A pivotal moment came when, aged nine or 10, Grisel found her mother crying at the kitchen sink. “I asked her what the matter was and she answered that she was crying because she was so happy. My stomach sank a thousand feet because I knew it wasn’t true but I also knew there was no way to reach the truth.” Her mother’s insistence that the family ignored the reality of their problems and instead went along with a pretence of happiness had a profound and negative impact on the way Grisel herself came to understand her own emotions and place in the world. “What I learned to do in that moment,” she explains, “was to doubt my reality; to realise that what was critical in life was the story, the veneer. And that felt like dying.” So began Grisel’s search for a way to escape her everyday life, a life that felt false and full of pressure to go along with the pretence, and instead to find a way to feel something that felt like the truth. It started with an obsession with reading books, “I would read constantly, upside down if I had to,” and then aged 13 (reaching a key developmental point when the teenage brain is primed for risky behaviour) she had her first drink. “I thought, this is how people get through life. I can pretend all this stuff, because I can have this little secret where I’m nice and warm inside,” remembers Grisel. “It was the first time in my life I remember feeling relaxed.” Grisel swiftly progressed to the “solace” of daily drinking, smoking marijuana and regular drug use. “I loved being able to connect to my true self and I only seemed to be able to do that when I was wasted,” she explains. Unsurprisingly, she was soon in trouble at home and school, trouble that escalated through her teenage years until she was “kicked out” by her parents when she was 19 – dropping out of her first year of college at the same time. After years of trying a range of ways to stop Grisel taking drugs her family now withdrew financial support entirely. As she left home, despite her “brawny high school football player brother” crying in the street, she felt exhilarated: “I felt like all the restraints were off and things got very bad after that.” Increasingly detached from her parents, who she barely saw over the next four years, Grisel’s life became entirely focused on drugs. “I was scraping by on nothing but lies and evasion and my only priority was staying loaded.” Now injecting cocaine, her dedication to the next hit led to frequent homelessness and unemployment. When she did find work she stole from the till, she regularly took credit cards from strangers and ruthlessly stole money and drugs from friends. Soon she was “facing lunatic dealers and DEA agents” with a single-minded determination that she also credits with her subsequent scientific tenacity. The depravity of Grisel’s addicted life, described in the memoir chapters of Never Enough, illustrates the vicious cycle of the “A and B process” she explains in the scientific sections of her book. When humans engage in any mind-altering activity, the effects are known as the “A process”. Whether it’s the sedation of alcohol or the rush of cocaine, users often feel pleasure from the initial use of their drug of choice. But as Grisel is at pains to explain, “There is no free lunch.” It didn’t matter how high I got, I was stuck with myself She believes people might make better choices if normal brain function was more widely appreciated. “The brain adapts to any addictive substance or activity by producing the exact opposite effect,” says Grisel. This opposite state, known as the “B process”, is led by the brain’s drive to return to its baseline state – and it’s why hangovers and comedowns are such unpleasant experiences. Our brains are so efficient at returning to normal that with regular use we need more and more of the drug or activity to feel the “A process” and the oppositional “B process” kicks in almost instantaneously. Soon, as Grisel herself experienced, we need the drug just to feel normal and without it we only feel the negative impact of the “B process”. With addiction rates rising steeply, helping people avoid being imprisoned in this cycle is a priority for many worried parents, case-workers, researchers and Grisel herself. But, just as a simple set of causes of addiction doesn’t seem to exist, there doesn’t appear to be a magic recipe for recovery either. Grisel describes her own transformation from addict to sober scientist as a collection of coincidences and luck. “I was inexplicably fortunate. I think I was carried through by circumstance,” she says. A lucky break led to better housing and a move away from injecting cocaine. After a “terrifying encounter” with her reflection in the mirror, the final push she needed to start her recovery came from her parents. In a crucial moment of compassion from her father, he told her he wished only happiness for her life and the 23-year-old finally realised just how unhappy she was. A drug-treatment facility in Minnesota was followed by a three-month stay in a women’s halfway house and then Grisel began to repair her life. A key motivation for staying sober was her determination to find a cure for addiction. At the beginning of her career, Grisel and others in her field were convinced they would swiftly find that cure, but as neuroscientific understanding has deepened it has revealed just how much we don’t understand. “In the book,” Grisel reflects, “I was shocked that I couldn’t say that neuroscience is making great strides. It didn’t seem true to me.” Though she can’t yet offer a magic switch to turn off addiction, She now believes much of the answer lies not in manipulating DNA but in encouraging human love, compassion and connection. With more high-potency drugs available more widely than ever before, alongside a sea of addictive technology enticing adults and children to “fritter away our lives checking updates just like users fritter away their lives snorting cocaine”, Grisel believes we need a range of tactics to tackle the global problem of addiction. “The people right next to us are an obvious place to start,” she adds. “Human relationships and connections are the low-hanging fruit.” With her own 16-year-old daughter and grown-up stepsons she and her husband have prioritised staying emotionally connected to their children and, when they are worried about behaviour, sharing their own feelings rather than telling their children what to do. “I will say, ‘I love you and I’m really concerned about this. If you need help, I will give it to you,’” Grisel says. “But I will also be clear that I am not going to enable the behaviour.” Despite choosing to parent differently from the way that she was brought up, Grisel now reflects on her parents with compassion, believing that if you have a child who is an addict, “It’s an almost impossible situation to be in and very hard to know what to do.” Decades of research and experience have led Judith Grisel to believe that the dominance of addictive substances and activities in contemporary life are leading society to the brink of an addictive black hole and that it is only by connecting with each other that we can avoid being sucked in. “Right now we’re in a rising phase of escapism and pharmacology – this epidemic of addiction is really an epidemic of avoidance. Above all we need better ways to cope with life and to be present to our experiences.” Despite her concerns, she does have hope. “Ultimately you can’t avoid yourself. It didn’t matter how high I got, I was stuck with myself. I think we’re soon going to get to that point as a society and then we might finally have our moment of truth.” Then, Grisel believes, we’ll discover that the way out of addiction was actually inside us all along.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.45 BST Isabel Toledo, the Cuban American fashion designer with an avant-garde flair who created Michelle Obama’s distinctive lemongrass- colored sheath dress and matching overcoat for her husband Barack’s 2009 inauguration, has died. She was 59. Toledo died of breast cancer, her studio said in an email on Monday. She presented her first collection in 1985, but Toledo’s work grabbed particular attention after Obama became a fan and then wore the distinctive wool and lace outfit to the inauguration when Barack Obama became America’s first African-American president, drawing massive crowds to Washington and a worldwide TV audience. Actors Demi Moore, Debi Mazar and Debra Messing are among celebrities who have worn Toledo’s creations, both on screen and on red carpets. Toledo arrived in West New York, a town in northern New Jersey, from Cuba as a teenager, later attending, but not graduating, from fashion college in New York. She met her collaborator and husband, the illustrator and painter Ruben Toledo, in high school. She was an independent designer who later eschewed runways for museum exhibitions, starting in the late 1990s and served briefly as creative director for Anne Klein, from 2006 to 2007.. The color of Obama’s Toledo-created inauguration look took on a life of its own in the fashion world. Descriptions of the color changed all day during the inauguration, leaving those who had to write about it wondering how to describe it. Was it yellow? Apple green? Toledo called it “lemongrass,” a grass grown in tropical regions that has lemon-scented foliage and is a favorite in Thai cooking. “I called it ‘lemongrass’ because it’s not yellow, it’s not green,” Toledo told the Associated Press at the time. She said she preferred “non-color” colors. The fact that colors on textiles can take on changing tones is an important element when making clothes, Toledo added. “The idea that the coat and dress are gold to some, pale yellow to others ... gives that moment you happen to catch sight of it that much more depth,” she said. “It gives the wearer and the viewer much more of an individualized experience.”"

She shudders at the memory. Three years later she has turned it into a grand church to plantlife, an urban conservatory that appears illuminated by stage lights. Last year, sales of succulents rose by 34% as young people leaned into the fashion for houseplants, a trend explained both by itinerant living and the long quest for wellness. But here in south London their primary effect is drama: a giant cactus stands among hundreds of little sisters, the ceiling strung with succulents that fall in theatrical curtains from dainty chains. Wilson moved in when she was 24, after the death of her father – “a bouncer, a drug dealer, an actor – oh, and he was in the SAS”. It was an investment; her family bought the place both as a home for Wilson and her many pets, and for the studio space, which she rents out for fashion shoots. The light is extremely soft, the ceilings extremely high – the other potential buyer was a professional trampolinist. When she moved in she ripped up the lino, got rid of the mould, installed heating and a new kitchen, built an aviary for her 12 canaries and four Gouldian finches, another for the parrot, installed a tank for her goldfish and started to accumulate plants. Some came from Conservatory Archives in east London, some from friends, and some from Gumtree, including the cactus that had grown out of its previous home, and which she had to lop a branch off of in order to get it through the door. It’s beneath the hanging baskets, in her living room – “my colonial-style hotel lobby” – that Wilson sits on the antique three-piece suite (“I got everything from Newark antiques fair – all my furniture came to less than the price of my mattress”) with her two dogs, and watches sunlight stream through the glass ceiling. “The grand finale is when the afternoon sun hits the large canvas of cadmium red I hung over the dining table,” she sighs happily. In the back room beside a deep blue sofa, an antique armoire offers a pedestal for her miniature cacti, and some sprout cheekily from the drawers. Every surface contains a jumble of vintage planters containing the next generation of plantlife, pictures and boxes of birdseed. At the other end of the space is the kitchen, where a lone frond of ivy whispers its way towards the hob. Open shelves display a jumble of teapots and cups. The dark green cabinets, made bespoke by Naked Kitchens, reflect her jungle of plantlife, as do the 1970s tiles in the bathroom, laid in the palest of pink walls. A vast studio to the right of the front door is strewn with her canvases and the props from a recent photoshoot. Yet there is not a great deal of art on Wilson’s walls; instead, the focus is on the greenery that, as you walk through the cavernous house, feels less like a collection of pot plants and more like pets, or sculptures, or stragglers from a very good party. Beneath the white staircase stands a well-used piano, and the steps above hang with dried flowers. Upstairs are two bedrooms, where leaves tumble from the ceiling. “My most pathetic pleasure was finding a bedspread that matched the plant.” A tea towel-sized private garden is tended sporadically by her mum, and it opens on to a vast communal lawn, shared by a close collection of neighbours, who live in separate buildings that once made up the school. Though a minute’s walk from the front door, the screech and rush of the high street feels far away. Living here, Wilson says, has taught her she’s “good at keeping things alive”. Including, it turns out, herself. She used to suffer badly from anxiety and panic attacks: there was a period, in a previous home, when she couldn’t leave the house. But here, she says: “I’ve created a pod away from anxiety. It’s rooted in escape. All my friends come round and say they’re cured by lying on my rug. The birds are a living lava lamp.” Instagram @stephwilsonspace"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 01.05 BST A large tremor that caused houses to shake has been triggered by the UK’s only active fracking site, amid rising alarm about the controversial practice. The 2.9-magnitude quake, recorded near Cuadrilla’s site near Blackpool on Monday morning, is believed to be the biggest fracking-related tremor seen in Britain. Operations at the Preston New Road site had been suspended since Wednesday night after a series of gradually increasing “microseismic events”. Yet the 2.9-magnitude tremor, which startled residents at 8.30am on Monday, is by far the largest recorded at the site and is bigger than the 2.3-magnitude quake that brought fracking to a halt in 2011. The latest quake, which has been verified by the British Geological Survey, easily breaches the government’s 0.5ML (local magnitude) limit on seismic activity. Cuadrilla said it was aware of the seismic event and no fracking had taken place over the weekend. The energy firm said it was investigating alongside regulators. Residents in nearby Lytham St Annes, Blackpool and as far afield as Preston reported feeling the tremor, with widespread reports of houses shaking. Stephen Cheatley, a photographer who lives a few miles from the fracking site, said he “heard a bang, a bit like a shotgun going off”. “This was quickly followed by the house shaking for about five seconds. In my opinion, this was a pretty serious tremor,” he said. “It’s definitely the biggest since a natural one I experienced many years ago. I’ve been on the fence until now, but after that tremor this morning I think fracking needs to stop completely.” A resident of Lytham St Annes said there was a “very loud rumbling” and the “whole house shook, picture fell off a shelf” and that it was “quite scary”. Another person posted on social media: “I heard a loud rumble then the house literally shook. Scary stuff”. Cuadrilla saidthe integrity of its shale gas well was unaffected by the seismic activity. It added: “We appreciate this this has caused concern for local people and by way of reassurance it is worth noting that this event lasted for around a second and the maximum ground motion recorded was 5mm per second. This is about a third of that permitted for construction projects.” Fracking involves pumping water and chemicals into rocks at high pressure to extract shale gas. Fracking in England resumed last year after two tremors – measuring 2.3- and 1.5-magnitude – prompted a seven-year moratorium on the process. Cuadrilla has blamed the 0.5ML limit on seismic activity for stifling the UK’s nascent shale industry. It has called for a government review of the rules, and extra time to drill after its fracking licence expires in November. Ministers hinted last week  they are considering a review of the system after lending support to Cuadrilla’s campaign. A spokeswoman for the anti-fracking Preston New Action Group said it was “very frightening when you hear a loud bang and things in the house rattle”. She added: “Given that this quake was felt across Blackpool, the Fylde coast and beyond, what is likely to have happened beneath the ground to the well at the source? We should not be being subjected to this level of stress and fear. Fracking must be stopped immediately.” A spokesman for Frack Free Lancashire said: “Enough is enough. People are cowering in their homes and just waiting and wondering when the next quake will be and how much damage it will cause.  “We call upon our local MPs to come off the fence and press for an immediate ban on fracking. We are sick of being treated as human guinea pigs.” The Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who represents the Fylde coast where the tremors were felt, said he would write to ministers to call for a halt to fracking in Lancashire. He said the latest tremors showed that the fracking industry is unable to operate within safety regulations, and added: “It is now clear that hydraulic fracturing is not suitable for Fylde or the people of Fylde and I will be writing to ministers and the Oil and Gas Authority to call for full cessation of the shale gas industry operating on the Fylde coast.” "
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/27/ringing-the-changes-how-britains-red-phone-boxes-are-being-given-new-life,"It’s a design classic, but in these days of ubiquitous mobile phones, only 10,000 of the red kiosks remain on the streets. Can they survive the next decade? Stephen Moss Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.35 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 16.30 BST John Farmer, who describes himself as an activist shareholder, is a man with a mission – to save Britain’s red phone boxes. These were once a feature of every high street in the country, but now number only 10,000 or so (and half of those are decorative rather than operational). At the recent annual general meeting of British Telecom, which even in the age of the mobile phone has a statutory obligation to maintain a payphone network, Farmer demanded that more be done to maintain the traditional red boxes. It was a point he has made at past AGMs – always, he says, to audience applause. In 2015 the traditional red phone box was voted the greatest British design of all time, ahead of the Routemaster bus, the Spitfire, the union jack and Concorde. It was designed in 1924 by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, whose other creations include Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral and Battersea and Bankside power stations. Many believe Scott’s design echoes the tomb that the architect Sir John Soane built for his wife in 1815. In his 1989 monograph on phone boxes, the architectural historian Gavin Stamp called Scott’s cast-iron box “a classical design of refined sophistication and timeless elegance”. Stamp was a great enthusiast for Scott’s boxes and led a campaign to preserve them after they ceased production in 1968. In his book he lauds Scott’s original design, designated Kiosk No 2 (usually abbreviated to K2) by the General Post Office, which was then responsible for the phone network. “The Kiosk No 2 was a miniature building,” he writes. Scott’s K2 design, easily identified by its small, square windows, was superseded in 1936 by his K6, which was smaller and had larger, horizontal windows to let more light into the box. The K2 had never caught on outside London because it was expensive, but the cheaper K6 was adopted nationally and by the late 1960s, when the utilitarian K8 was introduced, designed by the architect Bruce Martin, there were more than 70,000 in use across the country. There are still numerous Scott kiosks in central London, many of which have been listed as historically or architecturally significant – a response to the destruction of many boxes by the newly formed British Telecom in the 1980s. Remarkably Scott’s original wooden prototype still stands outside the Royal Academy in Piccadilly. Across the UK, more than 3,000 kiosks have been listed, including all the K2s, so there is no danger of them disappearing from Britain’s streets. Neil Scoresby, BT’s general manager for payphones, tells me a revolution in payphones is under way, reflecting the fact that only about 30,000 calls a day are now made from them. Over the next decade, most of the current 31,000 street kiosks (they are mostly ugly, post-Scott designs) will be swept away and replaced by three metre-tall InLink pillars and other devices that combine free calls with wi-fi services and are funded by advertising, but about 2,500 red boxes will be retained and converted for digital use. The fact there were once more than 70,000 red kiosks and now only 10,000 remain on the streets suggests that a lot of boxes have disappeared. In the 1970s and 80s, many were melted down, but gradually aficionados such as Stamp fought back and the boxes’ aesthetic (and indeed monetary) value started to be recognised. Since 2008, rather than remove decommissioned ones that have not been listed, BT has allowed local councils and charities to repurpose them under its adopt-a-kiosk scheme. More than 5,000 have been adopted. Many now contain defibrillators, with the Community Heartbeat Trust leading the way in advising local authorities on conversion. The trust has adopted 1,300 boxes, more than half of which have been converted to house defibrillators. Other uses for the boxes are rich and varied. Book-swap points that double as miniature libraries are popular. The village of Marton cum Grafton in North Yorkshire was one of the pioneers, opening a mini-library in 2010; another was opened in the London borough of Lewisham in 2013. I visited the latter and was impressed by the range of books. Not just airport fodder, but novels by Orhan Pamuk and Henning Mankell, an ancient book of English poetry and the catalogue of the Mezipatra Queer film festival, with text in Czech and English. The box was adopted by the Brockley Society and is now looked after by Susan Bennett and Tom Simpson, although Bennett says it is largely self-managing. People bring books in, take the odd one away and take it upon themselves to tidy up the seven shelves. The Lewisham “microlibrary” was started by the artist Sebastian Handley. He has now left the area, but the idea has been carried on. One thing that worried me about BT’s adopt-a-kiosk scheme was whether some ideas might founder when the original volunteers moved on or lost their enthusiasm. By only allowing councils and charities, rather than individuals, to adopt, BT hopes to ensure continuity, but I still think there could be problems further down the line. Who will be looking after these boxes in 50 years’ time, and making sure they get a fresh coat of “currant-red” paint? Art galleries in old phone boxes are also popular – an idea pioneered by the Gallery on the Green in Settle, north Yorkshire, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. “A group of residents thought it would be a shame for the box to go, and the idea of a gallery came up,” says Mike Smith, one of the half-dozen local people who keep it afloat. “The thought that it would probably be the smallest one in the world was kicked around and Guinness World Records was approached, but they said they weren’t interested in definitively ruling on it, so the Carlsberg advert was used instead … probably the smallest one. That generated a lot of publicity at the time of the launch in 2009.” Attempts have been made to monetise some boxes, in partnership with the Red Kiosk Company, which has bought 124 boxes from BT under the adopt-a-box scheme (BT sells them for a nominal £1, although it retains a residual interest in their use in an effort to ensure its brand is protected). The company gets planning permission for traders to use the boxes, and charges about £300 a month to rent a box. Mustafa Mehmet runs a coffee stall in a kiosk in Hampstead, north London. He originally did the same thing in west London, but says he was driven out by Hounslow council’s insistence that he have a street traders’ licence. The problem comes when kiosk traders spill over on to the pavement, which is almost inevitable – try selling coffee to a customer with both buyer and seller inside the box. Hounslow council, he says, insisted the transaction should take place inside the box; Camden council, under whose jurisdiction Mehmet is now trading, allows a bit of leeway. Phone repair company Lovefone has a kiosk in Holborn, central London, in which it repairs cracked iPhone screens. The Lovefone technician who works there, Fouad Choaibi, loves it. “This is my office,” he says. He has been based in the box for two and a half years and has embedded himself in the community, making himself indispensable to locals with cracked iPhones. The kiosk is very profitable, proving it can be done if you get the concept right. But the high degree of churn in other kiosks suggests a lot of traders don’t and quickly lose interest. Next to the pier in Brighton, Senegal-born Abo Fall is selling hats, sunglasses and beachwear out of two adjacent boxes. He has been there for two years and is keeping his head above the waves, but he says it can be a struggle if the weather’s bad. “People like the boxes and it’s different from an ordinary shop,” he says. Wherever you see a red box, you will see someone taking a picture of it, although, as the traders know all too well, that doesn’t automatically mean they will buy a coffee or a sunhat. Plenty of other quirky ideas have been tried, with music a fertile source. A box in the village of Meols, on the Wirral peninsula, has been turned into a miniature museum dedicated to the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who used to make calls from the box and immortalised it in the 1980 song Red Frame/White Light. And last year, to mark the 5,000th kiosk adoption, a box in Kingsbridge, Devon, was turned into what was somewhat hyperbolically termed “the world’s smallest nightclub”. It is actually a way of raising money for a local charity. Visitors to the box can dial-a-disc for £1. Musical offerings include Blondie’s Hanging on the Telephone and ELO’s Telephone Line. The boxes are also useful for stunts. In 2011, residents in the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth opened a pub (called the Dog and Bone, of course) in the local phone box to protest about the closure of their real local. The campaign seems to have paid off because that pub, the Plough, reopened in 2014. Incredibly, I can find no evidence of any plays being performed in a phonebox at the Edinburgh festival. Next year I plan to give my Hamlet in a kiosk on the Royal Mile. Though this be madness, yet there is method in it. Individuals can also buy boxes that aren’t listed and have no prospective adopter, so are being removed. A box in poor condition will set you back almost £2,000 on eBay, or you can buy a refurbished K6 for £2,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT’s approved reseller X2Connect. Unicorn Restorations also supplies beautifully restored boxes – at eye-watering prices if you want a rare K2 – drawing on stock it accumulated in the 1980s and 90s when unwanted and unloved red boxes were plentiful. “We supply boxes to private buyers and commercial organisations,” says a director of X2Connect, Martin White. “They go all round the world. We’ve done shopping malls in Florida and Dubai. They’re very popular in Australia and America, but places in Europe take them as well. People put them in their gardens and companies have them in their offices. They buy them as birthday presents or just for themselves, telling us it’s something they’ve always wanted.” White says that eventually the supply will dry up, but his company has enough to keep it going for a good few years yet. The cult of the boxes is a strange and powerful one. The sculptor David Mach, who 30 years ago laid 12 of them end to end in the centre of Kingston upon Thames in a celebrated piece of public art called Out of Order, describes them as a “universal Great British thing”. “The design is fantastic,” he says, “and then it seeps wholesale into the ground and comes back up through the soles of your feet.” They have featured on a million postcards and, having been a central feature of British life for much of the 20th century, in many films. Tourists still go to the fishing village of Pennan in Aberdeenshire in search of the phone box that features prominently in the 1983 film Local Hero, not realising that the box used in the film was a wooden prop. Pennan does have a real box, with a less perfect view of the sea than in the film, so visitors make do with that. Scott’s kiosks are loved in part because they are redolent of a time when the British were willing to build a small house from which anyone could make a call. They represent civic pride and national confidence – both now in short supply. Farmer is horrified at my suggestion that we should just let them go. Objects have a use, so why keep them when they lose that use? He finds such iconoclasm detestable. “We don’t want to become like the Americans,” he says. By which I presume he means a throwaway society. But equally the veneration of the past can go too far. We surround Battersea power station with anodyne, absurdly pricey flats and tell ourselves we have rescued it, even though it has lost all its stark beauty. I wonder how Scott’s K2s and K6s will look 50 years from now, when everyone has forgotten why they were ever there and thinks they were built as micro-libraries and art galleries, coffee kiosks and collection points. Or in 1,000 years when, as with Stonehenge, our descendants will ascribe some deep religious significance to them. Which, given the way they are now worshipped, might not be far from the truth."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 11.46 BST Facebook is reportedly preparing to take on Snapchat yet again, with a new app built on top of Instagram to facilitate ever more intimate sharing of information between close friends. The new app is called Threads, according to the tech news site the Verge, which broke the news of its existence. The app, which is being tested internally at Facebook, builds on the “Close Friends” feature introduced in Instagram last year, which allows users to specify a subset of their followers with whom they are comfortable sharing more private posts and stories. With Threads, users will be encouraged to share more information with their close friends on a “frictionless” basis – automatically updating the app with information such as their location, speed and battery life, as well as sharing more conventional posts such as text, photos and videos. Although the app will know their location, it will not share the specific details with a user’s friends – instead offering vague summaries such as “your friend is on the move”. Casey Newton of the Verge argues that the app is an attempt by Instagram to build a service that could one day clone Snapchat’s “Snap Map”, a popular feature of the messaging service that shows the physical location of Snapchat friends, as well as a select few public posts. Before the creation of the Close Friends feature, such a service would have been very difficult to implement on Instagram, since few users would have been comfortable sharing their location with every follower. Although Facebook has many competitors, few have been subject to as much direct pressure as Snapchat. Between 2012, when Mark Zuckerberg’s company first released a clone of the messaging service called Poke, and 2017, when the Guardian stopped keeping track, Facebook had cloned, bid for, or used similar ideas to Snapchat no fewer than 18 times, including a $3bn acquisition offer (rebuffed; the company is now worth $22bn) and the wholesale reimplementation of Snapchat’s Stories feature, which had 400 million users on Instagram as of last year."

Heather Stewart Tue 27 Aug 2019 23.45 BST


First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 13.52 BST Jeremy Corbyn has backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs’ attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, with plans set to be agreed by the end of the week. In a meeting with opposition parties convened by the Labour leader, Corbyn opened the discussion by reassuring MPs that Labour would not seek a premature vote of no confidence that might stymie legislative efforts to stop no deal. But there could yet be a conflict over who should lead the push for legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn said he would “propose the parliamentary process which would mean the legislation can be laid”, though other opposition MPs have made it clear they believe the moves must be led by backbenchers. Key opposition MPs will convene smaller meetings to discuss plans for legislation over the next 48 hours and party leaders hope to speak again by the end of the week, according to sources. MPs’ efforts were given a fresh sense urgency on Tuesday evening as rumours swirled at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already due to break briefly for party conferences. A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen’s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council. It would give MPs little chance for parliamentary manoeuvring, but could just about allow time for a vote on any reworked deal Johnson manages to strike with the EU27, before the crucial European council meeting on October 17. One source suggested something like this timetable could be on the agenda at the privy council meeting. Speculation that Johnson could call an early general election was also heightened on Tuesday when the Treasury abruptly cancelled a major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. Instead, the Treasury announced that the one-year spending review, setting out the government’s economic priorities, is to be fast-tracked to 4 September – the day MPs return to parliament – in a sign that the government wants to highlight a new policy agenda before a potential autumn election. An agreement to focus efforts on passing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit was made at Tuesday’s meeting, attended by the Scottish National party’s Ian Blackford, Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru’s Adam Price and Liz Saville Roberts and the Independent Group for Change’s Anna Soubry. Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he would “put forward a proposal which will make sure that parliament is able to debate a legislative way of preventing the government crashing us out with no deal … the legislation will be laid by people from all of the opposition parties and will be supported by some Conservative MPs as well.” MPs are planning on using the same tactics as they did earlier this year when rebels seized control of the order paper and passed a bill led by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin that mandated an extension to article 50. Moves are also planned to force the publication of damaging no-deal preparation documents to win public backing for efforts to prevent a no-deal departure, as well as other parliamentary manoeuvres to try to block any proposed prorogation of parliament. Parties also discussed opposing holding the regular parliamentary recess over the party conference period in late September, though a Labour source said nothing had been agreed. In a joint statement published by Labour after the meeting, which appeared to retreat from the party’s initial offer to call a vote of no confidence and establish a caretaker government led by Corbyn, the party leaders said they “agreed on the urgency to act together to find practical ways to prevent no deal, including the possibility of passing legislation and a vote of no confidence”. The Labour leader insisted later that the option of a motion of no confidence remained on the table and could be explored simultaneously. “It’s nothing to do with whether people like me or not,” he said. “The priority is to ensure we don’t crash out of the EU. And we will put a motion of no confidence at a time of our choosing.” Although Letwin, Dominic Grieve, and Caroline Spelman, all prominent Conservatives opposed to Brexit, were invited to the meeting, no Tory MPs attended. Corbyn had made an offer to opposition MPs that he would lead a caretaker government for a short period to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call an immediate general election in which Labour would campaign on a platform of offering a second referendum. This has been rejected by the vast majority of Conservatives, as well as the Lib Dems. Rebel Conservatives and former Tories including Nick Boles, some of whom have been key movers in efforts to stop no deal, have insisted parliamentary legislation should be the focus. It is understood Soubry, a former Conservative MP, made a forceful case that legislation had to be a priority. Boles had said he was deeply concerned that Corbyn would attempt to trigger a no-confidence vote too early and wrote to the Labour leader urging him to “declare publicly that you will not facilitate an election before an extension of article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted”. After the meeting, Corbyn wrote to 116 backbench Conservative and independent MPs including Theresa May, Philip Hammond, David Lidington and Greg Clark, urging them to back the cross-party efforts against no deal. Labour said it had highlighted MPs who had voted against no deal on 27 March when voting for an extension to article 50. “We know there is a majority in parliament against no deal,” he wrote. “I am writing to you to offer to work together, in a collegiate, cross-party spirit, to find a practical way to prevent no deal.” Soubry said there was “no debate” that the legislative route was the best way forward. “A vote of no confidence is absolutely the last resort. The best way of stopping us crashing us out on 31 October is to pass legislation,” she said. “It is a very serious step to win a vote of no confidence and can only be done if he [Corbyn] is certain of winning it.’” The SNP’s Blackford called the meeting “positive and productive” and emphasised his party’s belief that legislation should be a priority. Lucas and Swinson also emphasised their support for the plan."
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/22/richard-booth-obituary,"Self-styled King of Hay who put the market town on the map by establishing it as a centre for the secondhand book trade Oliver Balch Thu 22 Aug 2019 17.03 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 19.48 BST On April Fools’ Day 1977 Richard Booth, who has died aged 80, strode down the high street of Hay-on-Wye, Powys, dressed in a home-made crown and fake ermine robe. His intent – to declare the small market town an independent sovereign state – was as visionary as it was bonkers. Today Hay-on-Wye, a pretty but otherwise unremarkable border town, thrives thanks to the remarkable legacy of its self-appointed monarch, who helped to establish it as a centre for the secondhand book trade and to create the environment in which the annual Hay festival of literature and arts was founded in 1988. The narrow streets of the UK’s so-called Town of Books now buzz with tourists and incomers throughout the year. Richard established his first bookshop in Hay, called The Old Fire Station, in 1962. With his gregarious manner and aristocratic bluster he succeeded in picking up for a song the household libraries of many landed families, and went on to set up half-a-dozen more bookshops in the town. To fill his shelves he also bought books by the ton from American universities and other public institutions. It was during his buying trips to the US in the 1960s and 70s that his vision for an independent, localised economy really took shape. He saw in America’s faceless shopping malls a taste of what was to come and was determined to battle against it. Secondhand books, in this sense, represented one-in-the-eye for corporate capitalism. Others followed his lead and by the late 80s Hay-on-Wye, with its population of less than 2,000, boasted more than 30 secondhand bookshops. His flagship store, Richard Booth’s Bookshop, did a roaring trade during the 80s and 90s, but he was never much of a businessman. By his own confession he inherited one fortune, made two, and lost four. By 2007 he no longer owned any bookshops, but his main store, which was sold to Elizabeth Haycox, an American investor, remains in operation. He also owned another shop on the high street until his death – called The King of Hay, it sold regal paraphernalia, journals, and some books. There are now slightly fewer bookshops in Hay than in the late 90s, but still a large number. Born in Plymouth, Devon, to Philip Booth, an army officer, and Elizabeth (nee Pitt), an heir to the fortune of the soap-making Yardley family, Richard attended Rugby school, Warwickshire, and first dabbled in bookselling while studying history at Oxford University in the late 50s, before setting up The Old Fire Station in Hay. He had moved to the town as a child, when his family had inherited the nearby Brynmelyn estate, which was eventually passed on to him. Early in his career he also purchased the town’s castle, which was in a state of disrepair but just about habitable. He loved throwing parties there for his friends, but the property was badly damaged by fire in 1977. Having been asleep inside at the time, he liked to claim that he mistook the sound of crackling flames for the cheering of his subjects. After the blaze he moved back to Brynmelyn, which had the feel of a massive, disorganised library. As a bookseller and King of Hay, Richard was always alive to the power of publicity. A British eccentric of the best kind, he never reined in his passion for the eye-catching and entertaining, the wacky and the wonderful. Quite the opposite: he revelled in it. Not only did Richard proclaim himself King of Hay; he appointed his horse as prime minister and proclaimed his close friend the model April Ashley a duchess. Other colourful flourishes included the issuance of passports, the printing of rice-paper money and the investiture of friends to his cabinet. His cabinet meetings would be held once a month, invariably in a pub; the passage of meetings was decided by the turn of a board game-style wheel. Options included “have a drink”, “defer to next session” and “chop off her head”. He also ran a not-so-secret local intelligence agency, known as C.I.Hay. Alongside his embrace of the absurd, Richard was a man of political conviction. Not party politics: despite standing in the Welsh Assembly and European Parliament elections as a Socialist Labour party candidate, his leftist credentials were always suspect (he decried the minimum wage, for instance). Instead his politics were of a more straightforward, honest kind. With the centralisation of power, he argued, came corruption, incompetence, and, worst of all, bureaucracy. He loathed bureaucrats, a sentiment that expressed itself in myriad campaigns over the years – against the Welsh Development Board, the Welsh Tourist Board, and, latterly, the Welsh Assembly. Declaring Hay-on-Wye independent was not just about shooing off the pen-pushers. It was about forging a viable economic future for the quiet market town he loved so much. Long before terms such as “localism” and “diversification” were used in common parlance, he understood the imperative to step out of the mould and stake a claim for being different and distinctive. In the International Organisation of Booktowns, of which he was honorary life president, he found common cause with other book-besotted towns around the world, from Òbidos in Portugal to Paju in South Korea. In 2004 he was appointed MBE for his contribution to tourism in Wales. He is survived by his third wife, Hope Barrie, whom he married in 1988, and by two of his three sisters, Joanna and Anne. • Richard George William Pitt Booth, bookseller, born 12 September 1938; died 19 August 2019"

Last modified on Mon 7 Jan 2019 14.59 GMT Labour has accused the Conservative London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, of the “worst kind of casual sexism and misogyny” after unearthing a newspaper interview in which he praised the discipline shown by his teachers because they “were men, then”. Bailey, who will take on the incumbent, Labour’s Sadiq Khan, in next year’s election, also used the interview to argue that handing out contraception at schools encouraged teenage pregnancy and complain that young girls can have abortions without parental consent. Speaking in favour of school discipline, Bailey gave the impression there were no women who educated him: “When I was a kid, there was none of that PC nonsense. If you were wrong, they told you so. The teachers were men, then.” Elsewhere in the interview with the Sunday Times in 2007, Bailey repeated the point. “Our teachers were men, and we looked up to them. It was not a democracy. In today’s drive for children’s rights, we’ve forgotten to give them responsibility.” Bailey was speaking shortly after he had been selected to become the Conservatives’ candidate for Hammersmith at the 2010 general election, a race he lost to Labour. Last autumn, the 47-year-old was selected as the party’s candidate to fight Khan for the London mayoralty. The Conservative also complained about teenage pregnancy, saying that the state was not giving parents enough authority over children. “A classic example is, you’re meant to get your 14-year-old daughter to school, and if you don’t, you’re in trouble. And yet your 14-year-old daughter can have an abortion without you knowing. Who is in charge?” Bailey said. He also complained about supplying contraceptives at schools. “We do not do enough to deter our teenagers from becoming parents. In fact, we positively encourage it. What kind of message does the fact that we hand out condoms to children as young as 13 send out?” Seema Malhotra, a Labour MP, seized on the remarks to accuse Bailey of holding “backward views straight out of the 1950s – laced with the worst kind of casual sexism and misogyny”. She accused him of having “a long and hideous track record of misogyny and divisiveness”. It is not the first time that Bailey’s past comments have caused controversy. Shortly after he was selected in October, it emerged that he had written a thinktank pamphlet that warned that accommodating Muslims and Hindus “robs Britain of its community” and risked turning the country into a “crime-riddled cesspool”. Bailey, who comes from a family of Jamaican immigrants, said it was easier for the black community to integrate into British society because there were shared Christian values. “Within the black community, it is not such a bad thing, because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language. It’s far easier for black people to integrate.” Bailey offered a qualified apology for those remarks shortly after they resurfaced last October, saying in an article in the Daily Telegraph: “Yes, I have complained – in the rather raw and ill-judged manner of a man figuring out his world – about the lack of integration in our communities and its impact on social cohesion.” However, in a public meeting in Croydon a couple of weeks later, Bailey suggested his apologies were not absolutely sincere. “There are things I regret saying,” he said, adding: “But it doesn’t mean it isn’t true.” Malhotra said Bailey had been “completely two-faced with his previous apologies”. A spokesman for Bailey declined to repudiate the remarks from the 2007 interview, and said Bailey believed that “both discipline and a strict belief in personal responsibility were critical in helping him to thrive while growing up in a tough community”. Bailey also supported abortion and a woman’s right to chose, said the spokesman, but added: “Young women should have strong support structures in place at home to help guide them.” Responding to Malhotra, the spokesman said: “Rather than fight on the issues now facing London, and on Sadiq Khan’s extremely poor record in dealing with them, Labour are content to Google articles from 2007 and then feign outrage, none of which will stop the record number of knife murders or put Crossrail back on track.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.53 BST My favourite Jakartan is Evi Mariani Sofian. It’s not just because she knows the city’s spiciest fish restaurants, cheerfully brings her seven-year-old son along on her assignments for the Jakarta Post, where she is managing editor, and relishes a bit of good-natured ribbing at the expense of naive journalists visiting from London. Rather, at the risk of sounding grandiose, one hot day when Sofian took me to the city’s waterfront she showed me a new kind of journalism. Thousands of residents of Jakarta had been living for decades on the waterfront, in what the authorities call slums. Certainly, they live in homes built with their own hands, denied access to municipal services such as electricity and running water, and support themselves informally, through fishing, kiosks and services such as cutting hair. They were told the bulldozers weren’t coming – but one night they did anyway, crushing the neighbourhood into a field of grey rubble. Grimly Sofian led me across a landscape that in devastation, though not of course in body count, rivalled the scenes then playing out in Syria. She introduced me to the men and women who’d lived here their whole lives, and whose world had been destroyed overnight because hotel developers wanted to build a chain of islands that would look from space like a giant mythical eagle. Some of the residents had rebuilt new shacks, on the same spot, using the very rubble of their bulldozed homes – an almost crazed but entirely human determination that floors me as much today as it did then. To Sofian, it was Jakarta’s most important story: about who has the right to the city. But nobody had died, it wasn’t a campaign issue, and in many other ways it wasn’t the kind of story we might have told before Guardian Cities launched in 2014. The statistic you always heard back then was that 50% of the world now lived in cities, and by deciding to start a Cities desk the Guardian was jumping smartly on the opportunity to explore that other great 21st-century phenomenon, after the digital revolution: urbanisation. People were moving to cities in their billions, and most of the new growth was happening without a plan. The idea was for Cities to offer something different editorially from the political horse races and procession of fatalities that typically characterises the “news agenda”, but it wasn’t clear how. Fiery opinions? In-depth policy? Wonkish dissections of the minutiae of transportation planning? (Some readers still get annoyed that we don’t do more of that.) The Atlantic magazine had started Atlantic Cities in 2011 but otherwise there wasn’t really such a thing as “urban journalism”. I fancied myself a global journalist, and had written several pieces on international issues, but I was an editor on the Guardian’s Film desk at the time, and my only real qualification for a job on the Cities desk was that I’d lived and worked in four of them. I was a member of that semi-anxious, semi-rootless clan that seems to have proliferated globally due to the fertilisers of the internet and cheap(er) air travel. Before London I’d spent three years in Tokyo at the International New York Times tie-up with the Asahi Shimbun, and before that I ran a publication I still struggle to describe (a stunt-based conceptual magazine?) in Montreal and then Toronto with the artist Alex DeJong. (The magazine was called Trucker, and it borrowed Vice’s business model – parties and American Apparel ads – without the seedier edge, an omission that I posit to explain why I’m not living in a £20m villa in Santa Monica.) Luckily for me, Mike Herd, the founding Cities editor, took a punt on the idea that not being an expert in urbanism might be an asset for telling stories about cities. Mike decided he didn’t want Cities to be a site for talking heads, or for politics, or for transport minutiae. He decided Cities would be, in his words, “like the community wing of the foreign desk”, and his biggest idea was the “live week”: our team would decamp for a week to a global megacity, but not to report on a city’s issues for an audience back in London – we’d give a platform to locals, to tell their own stories in their own words to their own community. It was, and remains, a phenomenally successful idea that I have doubled down on as Cities editor. It is the heart of what “urban journalism” has become at the Guardian: reported feature journalism for global audiences, tackling the big issues of our time, from inequality to gentrification to how we move and live and work, without needing the justification of elections or death, although sometimes that happens too. Along with my team – Nick Van Mead, deputy editor, Tash Reith-Banks, production editor and Claire Burke, commissioning and community editor – we have now run live weeks in Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos, Moscow, Atlanta, São Paulo and Jakarta, where I found myself on the waterfront with Sofian and realised that she, too, was doing urban journalism. Now, I see it everywhere I look. In five years, cities have become big business: universities offer urban studies degrees, multinational corporations such as Siemens and Google sell “smart city” technology to punch-drunk mayors, and there are dozens of “urban” websites, from Citymetric to Citiscope to the terrific US site Citylab, as Atlantic Cities was renamed. Guardian Cities now regularly attracts more than 5m page views each month, we are expanding into film and podcasts, and I’m even seeing a new kind of urban crossover journalist, brilliant architecture and design critics such as the Guardian’s Oliver Wainwright, the Observer’s Rowan Moore or the New York Times’s Michael Kimmelman who have branched out into telling gripping stories about cities and people, not just buildings. Inside the Guardian, Cities has found a home alongside the foreign desk, as well as environment, science, health and technology, supporting the correspondents and a growing global stable of freelance journalists (send us your pitch!) to break news outside the standard news cycle. How air pollution is choking us. The insidious creep of privately owned public space. Why developers are building segregated playgrounds (hint: so rich and poor kids don’t mix). Where else but Guardian Cities could I have pursued my obsession with concrete? Above all, we’ve been able to tell stories of people banding together to make their cities better when everyone above them is against them. Everywhere we’ve been, I’ve seen it: in the Seoul neighbourhood in the Mexico City community centre that declared a violence-free zone (and threw us a terrific neighbourhood block party), or the Juhu Beach shelter for street kids without parents in Mumbai, or the jaw-dropping 8,000-strong tent city of São Paulo, where the activist and presidential candidate Guilherme Boulos told me: “Brazil’s homeless have organised. This is what it looks like.” After our visit to the waterfront, Sofian took me to the city’s next target for demolition, the riverside kampung of Tongkul. I expected a shantytown clinging to the banks. What I found was a blissfully cool, tree-lined street of houses gloriously clad in tiles and bamboo and coloured plastic, with slow fans and lazy cats and bicycles and recycling bins and everywhere plants. Gugun Muhammad and the residents convened an impromptu lunch. They showed us how they’d built rafts to clean the polluted river, and voluntarily (voluntarily!) destroyed the front rooms of their homes to meet the city’s request that they not “crowd” the riverbank. The authorities called it illegal anyway. They’ll probably knock it all down. Sofian’s still fighting for the community and Cities will too. They have a right to their home. Of all the places we visited in Jakarta, from the malls to the monuments to the mansions, that “slum” was the nicest neighbourhood by far."
https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/26/edinburgh-rightwing-comedians-titania-mcgrath-brexit-party-edinburgh-fringe,"This year’s Edinburgh fringe was full of wokeness jokes from liberal standups as well as a host of conservative comedians who punch down Brian Logan Mon 26 Aug 2019 06.00 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 06.02 BST Has there been a rise in rightwing comedy? Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim – flogged to death by the conservative commentariat – is that comedy is dominated by a “liberal elite”. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late Jeremy Hardy, the Marks Steel and Thomas, and mid-career Josie Long, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it’s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup Geoff Norcott had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose du jour, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations. They draw their charge – such as it is – from the conceit that they’re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it’s Transgressive – the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse’s show – to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are full of this stuff. You can’t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If – as these comics insist – free speech is under attack, it’s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse’s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after protests about its alleged transphobia. Perhaps that’s why “we’re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days”, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin made the headlines last year by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a “behavioural agreement” relating to the content of his act. (He doesn’t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media. He also contradicts himself. We mustn’t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says – then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby’s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a prexit Party candidate for parliament) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that “all taxation is theft”, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons. But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about “crony capitalism”, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby’s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology. Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here – although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we’re all more mindful of diversity and inclusion these days – and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby’s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so Titania McGrath, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle – now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness. The show’s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn’t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have – and jokes to make – about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became “a far-right dog whistle”, and it’s a good question. It’s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics – like Ahir Shah, say, with his routine on the phrase “people of colour” (“as if I’m indistinguishable from a black woman”). If there’s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there’s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern’s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called “cash for access” scandal. Now she’s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron’s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (“Some of their policies don’t sit well with me”) But if hers is a low-wattage show, it’s not objectionable. Nor does it – or any of the shows mentioned – herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn’t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about. But there have always been comics who do that, or who trade in chauvinist stereotypes, or promote individualist values. (As Leo Kearse points out: standup is the ne plus ultra Thatcherite industry.) Kearse, Frisby and co are just the latest in their line. All that’s changed – after Norcott banished the stigma, and advertised the career benefits, of calling oneself rightwing – is the branding."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.25 BST These are tough times to be an estate agent. A period of rocketing prices in the middle of the decade has made residential property expensive. Buyers are unable or unwilling to pay the prices demanded by sellers and with unemployment low sellers feel in no need to adjust their expectations downwards. The result is a flat market with next to no house price inflation. Or so it seemed before the release of the latest UK Finance figures for mortgage lending, which showed approvals at a 28-month high. Boom times are back for the housing market. Or perhaps not. One explanation for the strong data is that buyers are worried about a no-deal Brexit and are doing their deals while the going is good. This seems implausible for a number of reasons. Firstly, the UK Finance figures are for July, which was before the odds shortened on Britain leaving without a deal. Secondly, since the referendum consumers have doggedly refused to get het up about Brexit. Finally, if potential buyers really imagine Brexit is going to be an economic cataclysm they would be sitting tight until after 31 October in expectation of sharply lower prices. Hansen Lu, property economist at Capital Economics, makes the point that UK Finance figures only cover mortgage lending by banks, which constitutes about two thirds of the total. Bank of England data covering the entire mortgage market suggests activity is less strong. Competition to sell mortgages is as keen now as it was before the financial crisis of 2008, only with much lower interest rates. The idea that this is a new dawn for the property market is mistaken. This is simply banks offering a variety of low-cost deals and securing market share at the expense of their rivals. Kerching! Equity partners at Deloitte are in for an average payout of £882,000 this year – a £50K increase on 2018 and the highest in a decade. This amounts to a two-fingered salute to parliament, the Competition and Markets Authority and the public alike. The accountants have taken some serious stick in recent years, all of it deserved, but seem impervious to it. If the mortgage market is an example of competition at its keenest then accountancy is a textbook case of what happens when there is little or no competition. Four big firms dominate the market and exploit their market power to the full. Firms pay more than they would have to in a properly competitive market, too often – as the Financial Reporting Council has found – for substandard work. Scrutiny of the accountants has intensified after the high-profile collapses of Carillion, Patisserie Valerie and BHS. But judging by the payouts at Deloitte, the first of the big four to publish its 2019 results, perhaps by not enough. Massive pay outs to partners are only possible because firms are able to sell lucrative consultancy services on the back of audits. The CMA has called for greater distance between the two arms of the accountants’ businesses but decided against recommending that they should be broken up. A opportunity wasted, sadly. It has been a long time since UBS Wealth Management advised its clients to go underweight in equities: the period in 2012 when the euro was on the brink of collapse and Mario Draghi ultimately came to the rescue with his “whatever it takes” speech. But its easy to see why the advice is being given again. China’s yuan fell to an 11-year-low on the currency markets in response to the escalation of its trade war with the US. The financial markets are skittish, down last week because of new tariff announcements from Washington and Beijing, up yesterday because Donald Trump said at the G7 in Biarritz that China is now keen on a deal. In truth, Trump can carry on waging his trade war or he can sustain share prices at their current levels. He can’t have both."
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/26/baroque-petworth-beauties-to-have-their-severed-legs-reinstated,"Portraits had limbs cut off in 1820s to make room for more paintings in function room Mark Brown Arts correspondent Mon 26 Aug 2019 06.00 BST In a studio deep in Croydon, two supremely well connected ladies of Queen Anne’s court are about to go through an indignity they could never have imagined – to have their legs restored. The National Trust has revealed details of one of the most unusual and ambitious art restoration projects it has carried out, to reinstate the petticoated lower legs to paintings 200 years after one of their owners ordered them to be cut off. The sitters are Rachel Russell, the Duchess of Devonshire, and Lady Mary Somerset, the Duchess of Ormonde, who was eulogised by the poet John Dryden: “Whose face is Paradise, but fenced from sin/For God in either eye has placed a cherubin.” They were painted by Michael Dahl and are from a set of eight portraits commissioned for the Beauty Room at Petworth House, a baroque palace in West Sussex. The “Petworth beauties” hung there undisturbed for more than a century until the 1820s, when the house’s owner, the third Earl of Egremont, decided he wanted more wall space for new works celebrating the Battle of Waterloo. Six of the portraits needed to become three-quarter length, he said: “I will cut off their legs. I do not want their petticoats.” The legs were duly cut off and the pictures rehung, but in 1995 National Trust curators discovered something remarkable. The legs had actually been folded and tacked behind the paintings. The conservator Jim Dimond, who specialises in unusually damaged artworks, said it was slightly baffling that the paintings had been cut into separate pieces before being lined and wrapped around the back. “There is no logic to that … it makes no sense at all,” he said. One theory is that someone, whether the earl or a member of his staff, had sudden doubts about the endeavour. “The earl is not doing it because he hates the pictures necessarily,” said the curator Richard Ashbourne. “He is doing it because he wants to make more space in what is a really important room. He wants more pictures.” The project is still in its early days, but cleaning has already given a glimpse of how spectacular the portraits will look. The removal of thick layers of varnish and overpainting reveal muddy brown skin tones to be pinky white. The paintings are being restored before their display next year at Tate Britain as part of a major exhibition exploring baroque culture in Britain. Tabitha Barber, the gallery’s curator of British art from 1550 to 1750, said the plan was to recreate an element of their original display, with full length mirrors between them. “The Dahls of Petworth are among the artist’s very best works and we always knew that we would want to include an example of them in our exhibition, hopefully in their original full-length format,” she said. “That the National Trust has agreed to embark on this ambitious conservation project is truly exciting.” Dimond has until Christmas to complete the restoration and is quietly confident. The project is not without challenges though, including the fact that one of the portraits was not cut cleanly, leaving jagged edges to contend with. The National Trust’s curator of pictures and sculpture, David Taylor, said the significance of the two paintings as part of the “extraordinary picture collection at Petworth” could not be overestimated. “The 6th Duke of Somerset frequently dined in the room and hosted important visitors including Charles VI, future Holy Roman Emperor, where they would have been surrounded by the portraits looking down on them,” he said. The two duchesses portrayed were both ladies of the bedchamber under Queen Anne, a monarch well known to modern audiences thanks to Olivia Colman’s Oscar-winning portrayal of her in the film The Favourite. The paintings are part of a long tradition in Europe of series of “beauties” and are comparable to the Hampton Court set commissioned by Queen Mary in the 1690s.

https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/26/franco-fascism-spain-architecture,"As dictator, Franco built a cemetery with slave labour and orphanages for his murdered enemies’ children. Then Spain discovered tourism – and the lager louts flew in Jonathan Meades Mon 26 Aug 2019 06.00 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 10.31 BST The Basilica at Arantzazu in the Basque country was a collaboration between the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, who had just returned to Spain after 15 years in self-imposed exile, and the architect Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza (who would become celebrated for his Torres Blancos building in Madrid). Though they won the competition for the building in 1949, it was not consecrated until 1959, after a disputatious decade of ecclesiastical factionalism and local objections. The latter were preposterous given the building’s remoteness at the end of a vertiginous mountain road. The Basilica is the earliest of several Spanish churches whose novel dispositions of space anticipated and influenced the liturgical changes that would be stipulated by the second Vatican council in 1962. The exterior is tough, fortified, uncompromising. Its break from the conventions of sacred design was a papal snub to Franco, a reminder that his power was merely temporal. Luis Buñuel was the greatest Spanish artist of the 20th century. He believed that Picasso’s Guernica was a meretricious work that should be burned and that mortadella was made by the blind. St James, whom Franco would restore to the position of patron of Spain from which he had been ignominiously removed by the Republic, encountered the Virgin while praying on the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta, later Zaragoza. She was held aloft on a jasper pillar born by angels, hence the name of Zaragoza’s basilica, El Pilar. She set a precedent for attention-craving ascetics such as St Simeon Stylites, who lived for 37 years on top of a pillar near Aleppo and was the subject of Buñuel’s Simon of the Desert. Buñuel was the most devout, most observant, most gleefully blasphemous of atheists. After more than 20 years in exile, during which he became a Mexican citizen, he returned to Spain to make Viridiana: all necrophilia, incest and Fernando Rey. Because no one was looking and Buñuel was cunning, it was chosen as Spain’s entry at the 1961 Cannes film festival. Given the Franquist state’s zealous censorship of writers and film-makers, this was an extraordinary lapse. It won the Palme d’Or. All hell broke loose. It was denounced by the Vatican. Its production companies were closed down. Buñuel once again became persona non grata. Viridiana would not be shown in Spain until 1979, four years after the death of Franco – but not of Franquismo. Over 40 years on it’s still loitering, a grubby menacing sideshow. Equally extraordinary was the state’s habitual tolerance of nearly all forms of art and architecture. Like many dictators Franco considered himself an artist. He brought shame to Sunday painters. He dismissed as derisory the abstraction that was pervasive from the late 40s till the mid 60s. He rightly considered it politically and socially impotent. It wasn’t Goya, it wasn’t Otto Dix. It was harmless, self-referential pattern-making that, while it might provoke strong feelings about aesthetic legitimacy, was not going to fire up insurrection. And the various strains of architecture that asserted themselves over an even longer period were, like all architecture down the ages, near mute. Architecture is not a language. It does no more than grunt generalisations: “looking forward” or “summoning the past” or “aiming for the heavens”. Franco was described by Churchill as “a gallant Christian gentleman”. HG Wells corrected him: “a murderous Christian gentleman”. From an early age the future murderer unquestioningly accepted the Christian dogma he was force-fed at school in the Galician port of Ferrol – which was also an arsenal and a garrison. He accepted too a garrison’s hierarchy as the natural order: martial discipline, martial asceticism and martial mores. Add to those an oppressive, omnipresent religious credulousness that infected all aspects of life. Franco believed his destiny was to become the equal of the omnipotent imperial Hapsburg King Philip II. He also sought somehow to reincarnate the medieval military hero El Cid. When the dreary film with gun-crazy Charlton Heston in the title role was shot near Valencia, Franco loaned the production several thousand soldiers as extras – which no doubt helped with his metempsychotic ambition. Two buildings were deemed to be the pinnacle of Spanish architectural achievement. The Escorial was holy as well as regal. Juan de Herrera was commanded by Philip II to make a building that expressed nobility without arrogance, majesty without ostentation – rather like Polonius telling Laertes how to dress. Herrera was also responsible for the Alcázar of Toledo. Their obsessive and repetitive sobriety is, weirdly, as dizzying as the overwrought freneticism of the baroque or churrigueresque. And, just as weirdly, their chilly rigour feels protestant. They provided the model for Franco’s essays in “state architecture”, among them: The Valle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen), the monumental act of hypocrisy in stone where he is buried. This was the biggest slave labour project in Europe since the second world war. The slaves were captured republicans, political prisoners, housed in a concentration camp and worked to death with the assurance that “el trabajo enoblece”. Whose German translation is “arbeit macht frei”. The air ministry in Madrid. The disjunction of style and purpose again suggests architectural insentience, as though planes belonged to the 16th century. The University of Gijón by Luis Moya is the largest building in Spain. It was originally intended as an orphanage but soon became a technical school too. Franco created orphans by the thousand. Like Goya’s Chronos, he ate them by the score. He built orphanages; more like madrassas really. Indoctrination with lashings – take that how you will – of orthodoxy and obscurantism. The children of murdered republicans would be brainwashed with mariology and hagiology. Their heretical names would be changed from the revolutionary names their dead parents had given them: Passionaria, Luxemburg, Prairial, Germinal, Danton, St Just. Their teachers were brides and bridegrooms of Christ, the rank and paedophile of the Catholic church who enjoyed job satisfaction. Though Gijón is in the Asturias, the building’s distended classicism has nothing to do with the architecture of that province. It is rather an emblem of Franco’s moral reconquest, his sacralisation of everyday life, his castillianisation of everyday life, his unification. Provinces that didn’t fall into line were likely to suffer aerial diplomacy. This phase of official architecture didn’t last. The civil war and Franco’s collaboration seemed to get lost in a fog of international amnesia. This amnesia was encouraged by America’s strategic friendship of convenience: financial assistance in return for land on which to build airbases. Ideology could be suspended in exchange for white goods, jukeboxes, two-tone cars. The government was increasingly influenced by the lay Catholic organisation Opus Dei and its so-called technocrats, judicious pragmatists determined to open Spain to the world beyond the Pyrenees known as the continent. The architectural work of the Opus Dei member Miguel Fisac was part of that process. Spain was trying to achieve what would be internationally recognised as a sort of normality: fascism was, by the mid 1950s, a freakish outlier from a past that was to be ignominiously buried, along with its victims. The appetite for recrimination was frail. One of the few things buildings can articulate is newness, a prospect of a progressive future. Fisac’s quite wonderful Pagoda, which anyone arriving at Madrid airport and driving into the city could not help but see, was an unequivocal message that Spain had caught up at last, it was modern. And the modern state vandalises. This great building was demolished three decades after it was built. Infrastructure tends to endure more. Land colonies in the form of new villages were built in the 1950s and 60s under the direction of the agromomist Rafael Cavestany. The government feared a recurrence of the second republic’s food shortages and consequent public disorder unless something was done to tackle the inequity of land ownership. Agrarian reform would not only bring improved crops and improved livestock, it would transform still feudal peasants into sort of proper smallholders. The chaos of land ownership would be resolved. And the rural diaspora would be reversed. The villages invite correspondences with Nazi settlement programmes but the latter were more trumpeted than delivered, and where they were achieved they were folksy, wilful expressions of blood and soil. Thirty thousand houses were built in settlements of diverse sizes, many in areas that had till lately been arid. Franco boasted that his greatest legacy to the country he had otherwise despoiled was his irrigation of it. He built more than 500 dams. He liked to preside at their openings, quite ignoring how ecologically disastrous many of them were. His self-esteem swelled, a goitre of patriotic pride. Changing the climate – whether by cloud seeding or diverting rivers – is the mark of a human god, an aquarian magician who was described as a statesman unique in the world, laying the hydraulic foundations for the wellbeing and progress of his people. Bad geography meant too much rain in the north, too little in the south. Surfeit and deficit: with deficit came drought. The most grandiose of the schemes to overcome the natural imbalance was the Tajo Segura Transfer. Water is pumped to a height of 300 metres above the dammed Tajo in the mountains east of Madrid. Canalised, it flows 300km through a system of reservoirs, dams, tunnels, pumping stations and aqueducts to Murcia, the region of Spain most frequently afflicted by drought and the one that supplied Franco’s Nationalists with its most murderous butchers. It is anyway a great feat of hydraulic engineering. Whose beneficiaries were the latifundistas, the landowners who had backed Franco. And whose favourite sport was jocularly called agrarian reform. It consisted of hunting on horseback with packs of dogs. The quarry comprised destitute peasants, rural reds, bucolic bolshies. They were people who didn’t have a ladder to be at the bottom of – and whose body would be dumped in the usual pit. The other losers were the thousands of inhabitants of villages drowned because they stood in the way of reservoirs. Many of the interventions were also ecologically disastrous: in the age-old battle between environment and profit – here posing as the common good and agrarian reform – it was profit that won. The bottom line is the most potent of ideals. In 1948 Santiago de Compostela attracted half a million pilgrims … or tourists. They enjoyed such pious diversions as fireworks, football tournaments and bullfights, even though the last were not, and are still not, locally popular. It was – still is – the least Españolada province of Spain, that is the least afflicted by castanets, bells, bulls and balls and all the Hemingway/Tynan nobility-of-machismo schtick. But the jamboree was not merely a question of devotion to St James, or of penitence, of absolution, of self-denial. It was an earner. Here was an opportunity for the pariah state, denied foreign aid, to get its fascist gauntlets on some democratic coin: sovs, krone, francs. The germ of an idea was planted. Pedro Zaragoza was an energetic Franquist placeman born in the small, economically straitened fishing port between Valencia and Alicante. He was sent back there from Madrid to be its mayor at the age of 28. Zaragoza would become one of the most effective urbanists in the world. Not least because he had probably never heard of the pseudoscience of urbanism, had never shown interest in theories that fell off the back of a lorry loaded with dogmatic pretention. He turned an off-the-map village into an enterprise that changed a nation. When he took up his post in 1950, Benidorm had four hotels – hostels really – which provided fewer than 100 beds. “Render unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s and unto God the things which be God’s.” Together with Jesus’s retort to Pilate that “my kingdom is not of this world”, this may be read as a way of emphasising that the temporal state and the sacred church are separate. So while God-botherers may have indignantly objected to displays of flesh, to displays of public drunkenness, to displays of mob loutishness by Ingerlandlandland’s finest, their opinion counted for little. Impious money will always take precedence over prim morality. Throwing the merchants out of the temple was the work of a prig. Police were instructed to turn a blind eye, which, given what they would be having to look at, was probably what they wanted anyway – though when they did intervene it was with batons, firearms, chains and daft hats. That’s just good old-fashioned coppering, Spanish style. Franco hugely approved of the place. Forget the provenance. It’s no more wicked than a Volkswagen car. And it’s an architectural marvel where on any given night you can hear one of the 17 bands that claim to be the authentic Rubettes damaging their throats. Franco Building by Jonathan Meades is on BBC Four at 10pm on 27 August."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 11.32 BST As temperatures soared to over 30C (86F) in London, the tempo picked up at the Notting Hill carnival – and so did the costumes. The elaborate handmade outfits known as mas – short for masquerade – are at the heart of the annual spectacular. Carnival troupes often gather together in mas camps to make costumes months in advance of the carnival. The idea of playing mas as part of a carnival band originated in Trinidad and has become a vivid feature of the Notting Hill parades. When the London School of Samba joined the annual event 35 years ago it blended African and Brazilian carnival with the traditional caribbean celebration. These days performers and revellers shake their feathers to music pumping through 36 sound systems playing an array of music from reggae and ska to Latin and soca, drum’n’bass and grime, in what has become Europe’s largest street party."
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/27/ugly-kid-joe-how-we-made-everything-about-you,"‘We used helium-filled sex dolls in the video. One broke loose and planes landing at the local airport could see it in the sky’ Interviews by 
Henry Yates Tue 27 Aug 2019 06.00 BST I was in my last year of high school. Glam rock and pop rock were huge. Bon Jovi and the Scorpions were doing all their big ballads and it seemed like every frickin’ song was about love or sex. Y’know: “Chicks are rad, sex is rad.” I used to mess around with my parents’ piano and I just started playing that main riff. I was already friends with Whit [Crane, singer] and we’d hang out with this other guy, Farrell T Smith. He was Mr Negative. Farrell hates everything. He’s like: “Man, I don’t wanna go to the beach because you get sand in your shoes.” So I started imagining him and I came up with that first line: “I hate the rain and sunny weather.” I got my Tascam four-track cassette recorder, made this little song – and then it sat on the backburner for four years until we needed a longer live set. The rap outro sounds like I made it up on the spot … I think I did. I wanted the guitar solo to have that blues vibe, a little bit of Chuck Berry and CC DeVille from Poison. Writing it was easy, but then I had to recreate it. It’s so simple that, if you make a mistake, it’s very obvious. Every now and then, I’d miss that last note live and it was like: “Oh man, that was my moment and I screwed it up!” The record company wanted to choke us: “Please put hot chicks in your videos!” But we weren’t that kind of band. We made the video on a beach in Isla Vista, California. There were these two stray dogs running around and pissing on the drums. The director – Thomas Mignone – had this crazy idea to have all these floating blow-up sex dolls. They filled them with helium, but it turned out the plastic was too heavy, so they had to buy a bunch of balloons and tie them on to the dolls. The string broke on one of them – and I heard a news story about planes coming into the local airport and spotting this blow-up doll up in the sky. When you get overexposed on one song, it definitely has a backlash. We got a lot of flak for being this obnoxious joke band. But at the same time, hits open up doors. Everything About You made us almost a household name, almost overnight. I was young and I looked up to Klaus. When he played me the demo of Everything About You on a little analogue tape, I was excited that he was showing me something because it meant I could maybe be in a band with him. Back then, I was more than cynical – I was downright negative – and every line made me laugh. The song had humour. We were, like, the last “smile” band to get through the door before grunge came and decimated everybody. But I remember thinking, “It’s not heavy enough.” I wanted to be in Black Sabbath or Judas Priest. Everything About You didn’t necessarily sound like that. There was another song on the album called Mr Record Man that I made Klaus sing, and Everything About You went through a moment in time when I didn’t want to sing it either. But Klaus said, “Will you please just sing it?” and I’m like, “All right, all right …” I wrote the rap outro because we wanted to be Red Hot Chili Peppers – of course we’ll never be that cool. It sounds like I made that rap up on the spot – and I think I did. I wasn’t experienced enough to know where I wanted to take the song’s vocal. I was a good live singer, but I was scared of the microphone and the studio. When we made Everything About You, the record label weren’t expecting much of us, which gives you a lot of freedom. For the song’s intro, before the music starts, we got the comedian Julia Sweeney do a spoken-word sketch as Pat, her character from Saturday Night Live. I don’t know where the “shave and a haircut” riff at the end of the song came from. I think we were mocking the world. We were always a weird band, and I think we still are. But once the song blew up, the label wanted to grab hold of us and turn me into Bon Jovi II – and that’s when there was friction. Back in 1995, I wouldn’t play Everything About You live, because I wanted to prove myself as a heavy, badass rock’n’roll singer. Now, there’s a lot of water under the bridge, and it’s interesting to see the joy our old songs such as Everything About You bring. It’s a song that has gone around the world, and pays the electricity bill, thank God. • Whitfield Crane tours the UK, 4-18 September."

16:16 Thanks for your company today - we’ll be back when the fun resumes four weeks today, after the summer holiday. 4.08pm BST
16:08 So there we go – another great race, and another great race which further cements Lewis Hamilton’s status as champion-elect. It’s going to be six driver championships for the stormer from Stevenage, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. But he’ll know already that next season might be different, because Max Verstappen is coming. F1’s next great rivalry is surely upon us, and doesn’t the sport need it! Updated
at 4.16pm BST 4.03pm BST
16:03 Here’s Giles Richards’ race report... Updated
at 4.14pm BST 4.02pm BST
16:02 And our driver standings... 3.59pm BST
15:59 Phew. That was another absolute jazzer of a race. Let’s have some full results... 3.56pm BST
15:56 “I feel really grateful for the day,” says Hamilton, and for the team for continuing to believe in me and for continuing to push the limits and to take a risk, a chance on me - we’ve been together seven years and it always feels like a new win.” Updated
at 3.57pm BST 3.56pm BST
15:56 “Congrats to Lewis for the win, he was pushing us very hard,” says Verstappen. “We treid the one stop so of course they had the opportunity to try the two and it worked.” 3.52pm BST
15:52 “They rolled the dice,” Verstappen is told, and his team praise his drive today. I wonder if he’s wondering why they weren’t thinking about how Mercedes would play things. 3.50pm BST
15:50 “Only you can make that happen ... brilliant drive,” Hamilton’s team tells him. “James, sorry I doubted your strategy,” he respoods. “That feels so good guys, I hope you’re feeling it too. 3.48pm BST
15:48 An absolutely brilliant drive from the champ, and a fine intervention by his team! Verstappen is second, Vettel third, Leclerc fourth, Sainz fifth and Gasly sixth. Updated
at 4.00pm BST 3.47pm BST
15:47 Lap 69/70 Verstappen charges in pursuit of the fastest lap, while Hamilton is going to be champion again. Still, even before this season is done, we can be excited for next season because something is very definitely happening with the yungun. Updated
at 3.48pm BST 3.46pm BST
15:46 Lap 68/70 He’s been closing for quite some time and now Vettel nails his Ferrari team-mate! He passes Leclerc and provided he stays on the track has snided him of a podium finish! 3.45pm BST
15:45 Lap 68/70 Verstappen says he can’t finish on these tyres and comes in. He must be so disappointed, but he’ll learn from it. 3.44pm BST
15:44 Lap 67/70 Verstappen led for 67 laps, but it’s not going to matter! His should’ve seen Mercedes’ strategy coming, pre-empted it, and now he’d be done! But they didn’t. 3.43pm BST
15:43 Lap 67/70 Hamilton is so close now, and Verstappen has nothing to help him beyond his own positioning on the track. And as they come down the straight, HAMILTON TAKES HIM OUT! VERSTAPPEN CANNOT RESPOND, AND THIS RACE IS DONE! 3.41pm BST
15:41 Lap 66/70 Hamilton is guzzling this gap now! 1.026s the gap, almost within DRS range, and Verstappen must be bricking it! 3.40pm BST
15:40 Lap 65/70 Verstappen needs to steal himself because it’s nearly time! Can he hold off Hamilton on the straights by taking up the best positions? 2.788s the gap, and this is brilliant stuff! 3.39pm BST
15:39 Lap 64/70 5.486s the gap; “Tyres are dead”, Verstappen tells his team, and Hamilton is going to do this isn’t he?! 3.38pm BST
15:38 Lap 63/70 Hamilton can’t quite see Verstappen, but he’s not far off. He’s getting nervous - you can tell by the way he’s asking his team about his bakes, who’re telling him to forget them. 3.37pm BST
15:37 Lap 62/70 Here comes Hamilton, the gap now below nine seconds, and striking distance is expected in six laps! That’ll give him two goes at taking Verstappen out, and given the speed difference between them, you’d think he’ll pull it off! What a great call that pit was! 3.36pm BST
15:36 Lap 61/70 Hamilton gets the gap below 11s for the first time and this is our full leaderboard: 3.34pm BST
15:34 Lap 60/70 Hamilton is tearing into Verstappen now, his team telling him that, by the end, the Red Bull will be down to zero rubber. 11.296s the gap, and this is getting extremely lively. 3.33pm BST
15:33 Lap 59/70 Vettel is charing after Leclerc, looking to nab third, while Hamilton cuts the lead to 12.560s. 3.32pm BST
15:32 Lap 58/70 Hamilton sets a new fastest lap and brings the gap down to 14.433s. My sense is that it’ll be just enough for Verstappen because a second a lap won’t do it, but perhaps the Red Bull tyres will knacker enough so bigger chunks can be cut off. 3.30pm BST
15:30 Lap 57/70 Verstappen leads by 15.506s and is on at his team to describe the gap. He’s so conscious of how important this is, but needs to maintain the equilibrium that’s got him this far. 3.28pm BST
15:28 Lap 56/70 Horner says Verstappen has managed the race well and now has clear road to “stretch his legs”. Updated
at 3.29pm BST 3.28pm BST
15:28 Lap 55/70 Perhaps Verstappen has seen away the worst now; he’s driving better than he did through the middle part of the race and Christian Horner is looking forward to watching the denouement. He thinks Mercedes rolled the dice because they couldn’t catch his man, and wasn’t tempted to bring Verstappen in because he’d have come out behind. 3.26pm BST
15:26 Lap 54/70 Verstappen humps through a decent lap and has now cleared the track of the back markers who were giving him a fair bit of nause. 3.25pm BST
15:25 Lap 53/70 The gap’s down to 16.018s at Verstappen prepares to lap Vettel, in fourth; Ferrari have had better weekends. 3.23pm BST
15:23 Lap 52/70 Hamilton sets the fastest lap of the race so far as Grosjean is retired. That gap between 1 and 2 is reducing all the time, down to 17.057, and we’re going to see how Verstappen responds to pressure! 3.22pm BST
15:22 Lap 51/70 The lead is now 18.269 and Hamilton is lapping more than a second faster. This is going to be tight! Updated
at 3.32pm BST 3.21pm BST
15:21 Lap 50/70 Hamilton isn’t sure he’s made the right move, challenging the call made by his team, while Verstappen is challenging his team too. I’d say Hamilton’s strategy looks good, because he wasn’t catching up and this new effort gives him a chance. Updated
at 3.51pm BST 3.20pm BST
15:20 Lap 49/70 Hamilton pits! He comes out on fresh tyres, comes out ahead of Leclerc, and have Mercedes stolen a march on Red Bull there? He might just have the pace to close the gap, now at 20.269s, and Verstappen stays out a lap longer; if he goes in now, he’ll come out behind, so perhaps he’s just going to hang on! Updated
at 3.51pm BST 3.18pm BST
15:18 Lap 48/70 Our leaderboard: 3.17pm BST
15:17 Lap 47/70 Hamilton has a pace advantage down the straight, but can’t get close enough to attack. His car is quicker, but not by enough. 3.16pm BST
15:16 Lap 46/70 Hamilton comes again, cutting the gap to 1.026, but doesn’t look to quite have the pace. What we’re watching here is what we might just be watching for the next five years, because these look a class above the rest. This could be a seriously special rivalry. 3.15pm BST
15:15 Lap 45/70 1.042s the lead as we hear about braking issues for Hamilton; maybe that’s why he’s narrowing the gap, on account of using them less. 3.13pm BST
15:13 Lap 44/70 Bottas is now up to ninth, behind Norris. He’ll need to make up 11s to get that sixth place he’s after. 3.11pm BST
15:11 Lap 43/70 This has been another really fun race, and there’s plenty of time left too. We should be good for at least a couple more fights between the front two. 3.10pm BST
15:10 Lap 42/70 Verstappen’s lead is up to 1.8s and he’s told by his team that “he’s seen the best of his tyres”. 3.10pm BST
15:10 Lap 41/70 Hamilton’s told to keep the pressure on and tells his team that he can’t. Verstappen is flustered, but will have taken so much confidence from that last duel."
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/24/bring-the-outside-in-how-to-style-your-home-make-most-of-nature,"This contemporary home maximises its location with outdoor rooms and picture windows Rachel Leedham Sat 24 Aug 2019 11.00 BST With its seamless indoor and outdoor living spaces, and its Australian owner, this contemporary family home is more Brisbane than Britain. Tucked behind a suburban street, the plot, which formerly housed garages, is bordered by a stream with parkland beyond and surrounded by greenery. “When I get back from work I’m greeted by views of woodland, and the sounds of water and birdsong; it’s instantly calming,” says Pia Fairhurst. She shares the home with her husband Jonny and their daughters Paris, nine, and Amelie, six. “We loved the idea of having no direct neighbours, and access to the garden from all sides.” The house takes full advantage of its bucolic setting: glazed doors connect each of the key living spaces with an outdoor terrace. Outside a reading room’s picture window, hardy ornamental grass (Stipa tenuissima) sways gently in the breeze and masks a rare glimpse of a nearby house. Indoor plants such as Ficus elastica ‘Abidjan’ (rubber plant) and Euphorbia triangularis (chandelier tree) bring bursts of green inside, too. The architects, 31/44, laid out the ground floor as four rooms: an eat-in kitchen with plywood units and walls; a utility room; a double-height reading room with a wood-burning stove, a skylight, and a vibrant mural painted by artist Emma Jones (emmajones.ink); as well as a more formal living space with a built-in fireplace. All the rooms are positioned around a cross-shaped hallway. On the first floor are a master bedroom, a further three bedrooms and a bathroom. A large roof light above the entrance hall brings daylight into the core of the building. It was while visiting the home of one of the cofounders of the architectural practice, as part of London’s Open House festival in 2016, that the couple learned the firm had just completed this house for a developer. “We hotfooted it over that afternoon,” Jonny says. “We could only peer through the gates, but that was all it took.” The flooring is a combination of large-format grey tiles and pale oak boards; oak veneer is used for the kitchen cabinets as well as the living room walls, the latter nodding to panelling found in more formal homes. Emma Jones also created the mural in the hallway, featuring monochrome botanical drawings. Planters suspended from the galleried staircase introduce more pops of chlorophyll. The furniture includes a smattering of modern-day icons – Hella Jongerius’s joyous Polder sofa and the Slow chair by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec – mixed with mid-20th-century pieces such as a G Plan coffee table. Inspired by the late landscape designer John Brookes – who created gardens as outdoor rooms, making areas for sitting and enjoying different views of the house and garden – the outdoor spaces include a sitting area, a dining area and two play areas for the children featuring a sunken trampoline, bars and a tree swing. There is also a kitchen complete with a vegetable garden, herb garden, barbecue, tandoor and pizza oven. Contemporary pieces by Danish brand Hay (hay.dk) furnish the outdoor seating areas, selected because they are lightweight and their minimal lines don’t obstruct the views from the house; the dining area features a table and benches from a German beer hall (found at a local market). “The furniture is intended to live outside all year round,” Pia says. “We soften it in warmer months with cushions, throws and rugs.” The garden is an ongoing project: “This year we have sown wild grasses and meadow flowers at the back of the house for a more organic effect, so that it looks like an extension of the park,” Pia says. Jonny, meanwhile, is planning to build a structure to cover the outdoor kitchen. “That way we can easily cook outside in the rain – or even the snow.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/24/lightning-tour-championship-golf-spectators-hospital-east-lake,"Ewan Murray at East Lake Sat 24 Aug 2019 23.49 BST


Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 01.41 BST Six spectators were taken to hospital in Atlanta after lightning struck East Lake Golf Club, shortly after play had been suspended in the third round of the Tour Championship. The PGA Tour confirmed later in the day that “their injuries do not appear to be life threatening” but a marquee golf event had already been overshadowed by a scene involving sirens and brief panic. Players had been removed from the course at 4.17pm with lightning in the vicinity. As is typical, spectators generally remained on the grounds. A Tour statement explained what transpired next. It read: “At 4.45pm there were two lightning strikes at East Lake Golf Club; a tree near the range/15 green/16 tee was hit and debris from that strike injured four people. “EMT [Emergency Medical Technicians] tended to those fans and two others immediately and transported them from the property via ambulance for further medical attention. Our latest report is that their injuries do not appear to be life threatening.” The decision was made that competitors would not return to the course, with play to resume at 8am on Sunday. Stark damage to the bark of a tree hinted at the severity of the strike. The Tour added: “The safety of our fans, players and partners is of the utmost importance,” but eyebrows were raised at the insistence of standard late afternoon play for the tournament leaders with storms featuring heavily in weather forecasts. The PGA Tour’s vice president of rules and competitions, Mark Russell, defended the third-round timings. “We had a situation where there were pop-up thunderstorms,” he said. “We have a meteorologist on staff. We can monitor that. And a lot of times we get lucky and we don’t get hit with thunderstorms, especially when it’s a situation when they’re pop-ups like that. “Now, that’s what we were faced with. We can suspend play and get people out of here if that does happen, but a lot of times we’re on the positive side hoping that we can play golf and get lucky and not be in the path of those thunderstorms.” When pressed on why fortune was even an element, he added: “I think if we did that [amended starting times] every time we had a possibility of thunderstorms in the south-east, we’d do that basically every time we played golf.” This event, the conclusion to the PGA Tour season which affords $15m to the winner, had been delayed for 90 minutes on Friday because of nearby lightning. This is the first time the Tour Championship has been played here in August, a month ahead of its previous date. The PGA Tour does not issue attendance figures but Saturday’s crowd was clearly the largest of this tournament week, as Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka sat atop the leaderboard. Thomas will take a one-shot lead over McIlroy and Koepka into Sunday, when he will restart his third round on the 6th green."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/england-rugby-world-cup-eddie-jones-owen-farrell-ireland,"Robert Kitson at Twickenham Sun 25 Aug 2019 22.00 BST They love a bit of karaoke in Japan and England’s supporters were in full advance cry in the West Stand on a warm Saturday evening. Bon Jovi’s Living on a Prayer was particularly popular – “Ohhh, we’re halfway the-ere!” – and, for many, the time to start believing in Eddie Jones’s improving side has arrived. Keep playing like this and knocking on heaven’s door at the imminent Rugby World Cup will become a realistic possibility. The usual disclaimer about August warm-up games still applies but try telling Ireland this was a contest without meaning – or, indeed, any sort of contest. The gap between the teams in terms of energy, power and accuracy was wide enough to be embarrassing at times. From Joe Schmidt’s perspective, with less than four weeks to go until their tournament-shaping opening pool game against Scotland, this eight-try skittling was as worrying as it gets. As for England, suddenly they are accelerating away in the opposite direction, their previously spluttering chariot newly serviced and running like a dream. There is just one snag. This is usually the point where they get ahead of themselves, start believing in their own brilliance and plummet as surely as Icarus. The difference this time is that Jones is determined to erase that possibility. He has been insisting for years that England will peak in Yokohama on 2 November and remains convinced “the best is yet to come”. To that end he is taking the squad to Italy this week for what he calls “a mini pre-season” with a view to refocusing the minds of anyone even slightly tempted to relax. It will not be all hard work – there might be the odd Peroni involved – but between Thursday and Saturday England will not be lazing around in the gondolas of nearby Venice. The aim is to get the players even fitter and remind them that, decent warm-up form or not, stiffer challenges lie ahead. In Jones’s mind it is akin to being a mountaineer: peaking too soon is no way to conquer Everest. “You never know exactly where you need to be because you don’t know where the opposition are,” suggested the head coach. “The only thing you do know is you’ve got to keep going forward and that’s hard. It’s like climbing a mountain; the higher you get, the more uncomfortable it gets. The ground gets shaky, your ears start to burn, your nose starts to run.” He believes upping the training intensity now and “going right back to the basics” is the best way to harden everyone’s resolve. He also now has a clearer idea of his first-choice XV, having finally stumbled on his ideal midfield and back-row trios at, respectively, the 17th and 25th time of asking. With Manu Tuilagi returning at last to full fitness and back in his preferred 13 jersey, the temptation to start him, Owen Farrell and George Ford together when Joe Cokanasiga is also available on the wing will now be hard to resist. The same is true in the back row against sides who compete strongly at the breakdown: assuming they all stay fit, Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill and Tom Curry offer an enticing mix of power, poaching ability and pace – if fit. They remain the two most critical little words for every coach and the scan results on Mako Vunipola’s hamstring – the same one that required a summer operation – will be keenly awaited. That said, England still have Joe Marler, nobody’s idea of a weak link, at loosehead and a number of other key individuals running into some form. Maro Itoje must have rivalled Tuilagi for the man-of-the-match award while Cokanasiga reminded friend and foe of his colossal potential – England also coped far better with Saturday’s heat than the wilting Irish and the sight of Tuilagi running free again lends his side a further fresh dimension. Those with long memories will recall Tuilagi, aged 20, running through Ireland to score an eye‑catching try in a warm-up Test in Dublin eight Augusts ago. On that occasion it proved a false dawn: Tuilagi ended up in Auckland harbour, England’s 2011 Rugby World Cup hopes having already been sunk by quarter-final defeat to France the previous day. Their prospects this time are improving by the day. If the big games at this World Cup were being played at Twickenham, as was the case in 2015, England might even be emerging favourites. The four previous World Cup campaigns, though, long ago taught Jones to expect the unexpected. For that reason he deliberately arranged for his players to arrive at the stadium around 20 minutes later than usual, to replicate what might happen in Japan. Better late, it transpired, than to follow Ireland’s example and not turn up at all. Nothing much seemed to affect Cokanasiga’s timing: the big winger touched down twice and was a constant menace to an Irish defence that missed a staggering 38 tackles. Itoje also helped make a mess of the Irish lineout, leaving the visiting captain, Rory Best, to warn his players they will need to raise the intensity at which they train. England already have that box ticked, with only Friday week’s final warm-up against Italy in Newcastle to play before they swap the north-east for east Asia. Hopefully they will take Harlequins’ Joe Marchant with them – the Marchant of Venice is too good a headline to waste – but, either way, they will relocate with the applause of Twickenham ringing in their cauliflower ears. Halfway there? Project Eddie feels closer to fruition than it has ever done."
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/27/childrens-picture-books-review-fate-of-fausto-oliver-jeffers-1001-ants-small-in-city,"Beautiful hymns to nature and the modern metropolis are among this month’s highlights Imogen Carter Tue 27 Aug 2019 09.00 BST Many of Oliver Jeffers’s books have a folk tale flavour, their gentle messages smuggled in via offbeat characters with extraordinary skills or habits (think of The Incredible Book Eating Boy or the girl who hides her heart away in The Heart and the Bottle). Yet The Fate of Fausto (Harper Collins), “a painted fable”, as Jeffers describes it, feels like a fantastically fresh departure. Fausto is a pompous, pinstripe-suited man with a twirly moustache and a desire to own the natural world. “Tree, you are mine,” he shouts before moving on to the lake as the tree bows obediently. More spare in text and imagery than its predecessors, it’s a tale full of suggestion with expanses of white page wittily used as pregnant pauses and punctuation. In an age of exquisite picture books, this is possibly the most beautiful of the year. Made with traditional lithographic printmaking techniques, neon pink and yellow shades zing against an earthier palette of green, teal and brown. The aggressive, bullying Fausto is both timeless and utterly of our age (straight out of Westminster, you could say). As he fizzes with rage and makes demands even a toddler would find ridiculous, he’s also very funny. He’s last seen stepping out of his boat to stamp on the obstinate sea. Another fun ode to nature comes in the form of Joanna Rzezak’s 1001 Ants (Thames & Hudson), a nonfiction book that feels more like a walk in the woods. Rather than pages heaving with text, we gather short facts about the countryside as ants march through it. So when the ants brush past a fern we learn that these plants are older than the dinosaurs and when they run into a snail, that its average speed is three inches a minute. Children will love trying to spot the ant in red socks featured on every spread. A thin skyscraper of a book, Small in the City by Sydney Smith (Walker) explores the sights, sounds and dangers of the modern metropolis as seen through a little protagonist’s eyes on a wintry day. Smith won the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal last year for illustrating Town Is by the Sea, about a young boy in a seaside mining community, and he can conjure up a North American cityscape just as impressively – all gridded streets and buildings, traffic lights and crowds (Smith lives in Toronto). The narrator begins: “I know what it’s like to be small in the city... Construction sites pound and drill and yell and dig”, before offering advice about where to find comfort and make friends. Towards the end of the book, we learn who the advice is for, adding even more depth to this warm, sweet tale (it’s hard to resist immediately rereading). City living is also the subject of Felicita Sala’s debut picture book, Lunch at 10 Pomegranate Street (Scribe). Part biography of an apartment block’s inhabitants, part children’s recipe book, each highly evocative illustration depicts a different resident or family in their kitchen preparing a dish, with the instructions alongside. There’s Mister Ibrahim making baba ganoush who “remembers his childhood home and smiles” or young Maria who mashes avocados for guacamole. I was left longing for more meat on the story, but the book is a wonderful celebration of multiculturalism and food bringing people together. It’s also a unique way to encourage independent readers who are would-be cooks (it’s recommended for five-10-year-olds). As the summer holidays draw to a close, Matt Haig once again turns his attention to anxious children. In The Truth Pixie Goes to School (Canongate, illustrated by Chris Mould), the follow-up to his bestseller, The Truth Pixie, Aada struggles to make friends at her new school and her “100% fib-free” pixie companion really doesn’t help. Countless children will find solace in Haig’s tale and empathise with Aada as she overcomes hurdles before realising the power of being yourself. The world seems a better place with Haig looking after our collective mental health – if only he could sort out the angry Fausto types too. • To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.40 BST We used to think there were two types of posture: “bad” posture was slumped, forward-facing and painful, while “good” posture, to avoid pain, was holding oneself upright with a straight back. However, research has accumulated over the past three decades and now we know that it’s not so simple. Whether you’re slumping or sitting up straight makes very little difference when it comes to back and neck pain: sitting is what is known as a low-load activity and puts little stress on your spine, no matter your posture. The most important factor causing back and neck pain is actually inactivity. There is no one-size-fits-all posture, so making sure that you’re using the full range of your capabilities to keep yourself active is more important than sitting up straight to prevent backache. It’s also important to do strength and balance exercises – the NHS website has lots of useful resources for good exercises. Yoga and pilates can also be very useful to avoid back pain. Stretches that target the back, abdominal and neck muscles help with tightness from prolonged desk work. Even if you struggle to fit in regular exercise, there are adjustments you can make to everyday life to take care of your back. Taking the stairs instead of a lift, for example, or getting off your bus a few stops early and walking the rest of the way to work. If you’re stuck in the office all day, taking a “micro-break” every half an hour is vital. This could be just standing up and stretching; an easy stretch for the office is the upper trapezius neck stretch, which targets the muscles that commonly become tense after sitting for a long time. Instead of scaring people by telling them that their bad posture will cause them pain, we should be encouraging general activity, which will help more in the long run.

Last modified on Wed 21 Aug 2019 11.00 BST A drive-by shooting of four girls outside a nightclub in Birmingham in 2003 shocked the country. Letisha Shakespeare, aged 17, and Charlene Ellis, aged 18, both died, innocent victims caught in the crossfire of gang shootings. It set off a huge murder investigation, and when police examined the scene they found that one of the guns used was an antique and the ammunition was untraceable. Journalist Kenneth R Rosen tells India Rakusen how those bullets found at the scene in 2003 were the beginning of a mystery. Hundreds of ‘ghost bullets’ started to appear in crime scenes across the country and a long search began for their creator. Also today: on the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, the Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner on how that tragic day was to inspire the founder of the Manchester Guardian – and the parallels we can draw with events of today.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/26/guardian-readers-spend-25-hours-phone-screen-time,"We received 500 answers from those unhappy with their screentime (10 hours a day!) to those who happily log just two minutes Francisco Navas Tue 27 Aug 2019 06.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 23.50 BST Last week, we asked Guardian readers to share their screentime with us. How long did they spend on their phone everyday? Did they think they controlled their phones, or that the phone controlled them? We received 500 responses and did the math: the average Guardian reader seems to spend two and a half hours staring at a screen each day. Among the lowest times is John, from Derby, who said his screen time average is a puny two minutes. He’d swap the time to boil an egg, instead he said, though “it would be a very soft one”. On the other end of the spectrum, some readers wrote to say they spent between eight and 10 hours a day (!) on their phone. (One responder, perhaps not surprisingly, asked to remain anonymous). Heavy users reported feeling stress and a foggy feeling when using certain social media apps. Overall there were 75 mentions of Instagram, 52 of Facebook, 41 of Twitter and 39 mentions of the Guardian app (thanks for reading). Of course, take those results with a grain of salt: this is a self-selecting group. At six hours per day, Jessica Louise from Redhill says her average is affecting her relationship. “My partner often feels like there’s a screen between us”, she said. He wishes she could be more present while they’re watching movies at home. Yet, she is “awfully addicted to infantile games” like Candy Crush or Angry Birds. “What horrifies me is that I spend essentially a whole day on my phone each week,” said Jennifer Corlington in Sitges, Spain. She is making an effort not to use her phone in front of her kids, in an attempt to lead by example. “Either we’re with them or we’re on our phones but you can’t really do both,” she said. Ashleigh Young, from Wellington, said: “I do the classic mindless, almost catatonic scrolling of Twitter and often it makes me feel stressed or just flat, so I have now deleted Twitter from my phone and just have it for my laptop, so it feels a bit more conscious.” She added: “Maybe I should spend time differently, but then I’d have to face reality and that’s not a great option these days.” Mick Greer, from Saigon, said he has “no desire to learn the tuba or write the next great novel”, so he is not planning to change how he uses his one hour of daily screen time. Other responders were happy with their phone usage because they found their use of it was intentional, and spending four or five hours a day on it made sense to them. “Anyone who might judge a person for looking at their phone is clearly not thinking of the vast number of things they could be doing with it,” said Victoria from Swindon. Her daily eight hours helps improves her quality of life, as she trades messages and banters over Discord with her friends living abroad. Nightly guided meditations help her get to sleep, and music and games help her get through a noisy commute. Then there are those who made the conscious choice to gear their use away from recreation – little to no fun, purely function. Natalie, from Birmingham, is embarrassed of her four-hour time, which racks up during her 40-minute train commute. She uses the Google Digital Wellbeing app to set timers on her commonly used apps. “I am now allowed only 15 minutes on Reddit and this is more than enough,” she discovered. Opening Headspace motivates reader Joseph Slater from Cambodia who reminds us what Rod Judkins wrote in The Art of Creative Thinking: There is an art to doing nothing, intensely. The geniuses of the 21st century will be those who can unplug from the unyielding flow of incoming communications: emails, texts, tweets, Facebook, phone calls, and on and on. There’s no hiding place from screens; we work at them; they entertain us … To work intensively for long periods you need to switch off occasionally for short periods.” Lee Rice, from St Asaph, decided to go back to the dark ages and sold his smartphone last year. He says “life is a million percent better with a dumb phone”. For others, like Judah from Oslo, keeping it simple has been enough: “The best solution is to put the phone down. Even gazing out the window on my commute would be more mentally productive.” The bottom line? If these responses say anything, it’s not about how much screen time you accumulate or how you use it, but rather how you feel about your use. Take a step back and consider your screen time: do you feel depressed about it? Do you know, deep down, that you’d rather learn Chinese or make pasta from scratch? Or are you happy being connected to your loved ones all day? Once you have your answer, go all the way and switch back to a Nokia brick. Or, keep your iPhone X if your eyes have developed an insatiable taste for blue light. If you’re happy, we’re happy. (But, we can agree that 12 hours is ludicrous, right?)"

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 08.14 BST After a while you get used to people wishing you dead. In my case it helps that the ones making the suggestion do so lightly. Often there’s the catch of a laugh in their voice. It’s that stifled amusement, the giggle before the darkness, which alerts me to what’s coming. I am on stage in a small theatre or comedy club, the meat of my live show behind me, and I am taking questions. I am working my way from upstretched hand to upstretched hand, trying to be the most entertaining version of myself that I can. “Jay, so… Ha!” Here we go. “What would be your death-row dinner?” The audience laughs. The audience always laughs. By asking the question the balance of power appears to have shifted, and brilliantly. There I am up on stage, owning the space. And now here’s a member of the audience bringing me back down to earth by asking me to imagine I am about to be put to death for some crime of which I am obviously guilty. Then again, they have heard the question only once; I have heard it dozens of times. I reply. Some of the audience laugh. Some of them look puzzled. Others look utterly furious. As far as they’re concerned, I really haven’t played the game at all. The idea of last suppers, be they caused by the judicial system, suicide or misfortune of health, has long fascinated me. It seems such a simple question. You are about to die. What do you choose to eat? But it isn’t simple at all. For a start, we eat to keep ourselves alive. That’s the whole point of consuming food. It’s literally a bodily function. But if you knew your death was imminent, the basic reason for the meal would have gone. You’ll be long dead before you starve. So now it’s about something else. Do you choose comfort food, something that reminds you of the good times when you weren’t about to die? Do you allow your meal to parent you, to enfold you in the biggest hug possible? Or do you go for ingredients as statement? Should your last meal not be a time to wade into luxury and excess? And how big a part does memory play in all this? Those of us who are more obsessed with our lunch than is strictly necessary build our stories around mealtimes. We construct our narrative one plateful at a time. What’s more, now we can eat what the hell we like because there are no consequences. Usually, too much deep-fried, sugar-rich food would result in you feeling queasy and worrying about your heart, about what type of person your appetites were turning you into. Now, who cares? But there’s a problem. Let’s call it the mood issue. I am a man of appetites, but even I would be hard pushed to shove the thought of my impending death out of my head and get down to eating. Which is exactly what I tell the people who ask me about my death-row dinner. “I might be a greedy bastard,” I tell the audience, “but even I would lose my appetite if the next morning I was to be the victim of an appalling miscarriage of justice.” They wanted an account of unfettered, careless indulgence. Instead I’ve raised an issue of jurisprudence. In 2007 photographer Melanie Dunea published a book also called My Last Supper, in which 50 big-name chefs from around the world gave an account of what they would eat for their last meal on earth. They were then photographed looking thoughtful about their own mortality. In his introduction, the late Anthony Bourdain, the one-time chef turned writer and broadcaster, explained that these were people who had already had the opportunity to eat anything and everything. You name it, they’d almost certainly been served it. Hence, when asked to describe a final meal, these chefs would probably go after something that reminded them of leaner, simpler times before the glamour and pressure of superstardom. And there is a bit of that. Jamie Oliver chose spaghetti all’arrabbiata. Gordon Ramsay wanted a roast Sunday lunch. But they are in the minority. For example, Thomas Keller, once regarded as the greatest chef in America for his nerdy, intense cooking at the French Laundry, wanted half a kilo of osetra caviar, then otoro, the hyper expensive fatty belly of the endangered bluefin tuna. He followed that with a roast chicken, which sounded rustic enough, but then he went all in with a brie with truffles. All of this was to be served with a 1983 vintage champagne. For a reality check you have to look at the work of the New Zealand-born photographer Henry Hargreaves, an opponent of the death penalty. In 2013 he put together a portfolio of photographs recreating various real death-row dinners. Some seemed obvious. The serial killer John Wayne Gacy, convicted of 33 murders and executed by lethal injection in 1994, asked for fried shrimps and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh went for a whole tub of mint chocolate ice-cream. These could indeed be interpreted as attempts by troubled adults to reach back to the innocent comforts of childhood. In 2012 the academic journal Appetite published a paper analysing “death row nutrition”. The authors, Brian Wansink, Kevin Kniffin and Mitsuru Shimizu, looked at the contents of 247 last meals served in the US between 2002 and 2006, where the budget for the final meal ranged between $20 and $50, depending on the state. Some states allowed the food to be ordered in from nearby restaurants; others insisted it be made from what was in the prison store cupboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found the average meal was a hefty 2,756 calories, which is more than the recommended daily intake for an adult male. The requests from death-row inmates in two states, Texas and Oklahoma, were for meals that were between 750 to 1,000 calories more than in most of the others. Four of them were 7,200 calories or more. (One person ordered a dozen pieces of fried chicken, two rolls with butter, mashed potato and gravy, two soft drinks, plus a pint each of strawberry and vanilla ice-cream.) More strikingly, the average meal had 2.5 times the daily recommended serving of protein and fat. Chicken was the most popular meat followed by both hamburger and steak. Nearly 70% wanted fried food. In pursuit of the familiar, there were a few requests for named brands. They wanted McDonald’s and KFC. Coke was the drink of choice for 16% of those heading towards execution. Curiously, three of them wanted Diet Coke. Maybe they just liked the taste. There are other candidates for last meals. There are the suicidals, like Ernest Hemingway, who went for a New York strip steak, a baked potato, a Caesar salad and a glass of Bordeaux before shooting himself in the head. It sounds like a nice enough dinner, but is it unreasonable to suggest, given what he did afterwards, that this last meal was not an especially happy affair? Then there are the terminally ill. With the moment of death uncertain, timing is an issue, as is the ability to eat. Very few last meals eaten by the dying are like that served to François Mitterrand, the president of the French republic, who died of cancer in 1996. His last meal started with foie gras, oysters and capon, but all of that was merely an overture to the consumption of ortolan, a yellow-throated songbird, the eating of which was frowned upon by the majority of his fellow Frenchmen at the time and would eventually be made illegal. Even in a country that has always been ahead of the pack when it comes to ritualising dinner, the process of eating ortolan goes beyond what is strictly necessary. Traditionally, they should first be placed in the dark for a month, so that, thinking it is their night-time feeding period, they fatten themselves up. Next, they are drowned in Armagnac. Finally, they are roasted for eight minutes, plucked and eaten whole, head and all, the idea being that the sharp bones puncture the inside of the mouth so that the diner’s blood mingles with that of the bird. You are supposed to eat them with a napkin over your head so that the Lord may not see your sin, or so your fellow diners may not see you spitting out the bones. One or the other. Which is more extraordinary: the details of the last meal or the fact that this was the last meal of an exceedingly ill man? Illness murders appetite. Medication blunts and steals taste buds. Entirely reasonable existential angst, a fear of the end, can fill the belly with nothing but lead. The grandiose Mitterrand might have been able to pull off this final, shameless flourish, but I suspect that, were I in that situation, I could not. Indeed, I’m certain of it, because I am no stranger to near death experiences. It is the summer of 1984. I am 17 and alone on a beach in Tangier, on Morocco’s northern tip. The late afternoon is shading into dusk. I came here with six friends, our Interrail cards securing the 48-hour train journey from Florence to a town where impoverished backpackers can afford rooms in a four-star hotel on the beach. I feel intrepid. I have travelled. So why not travel a little more? While my friends explore the narrow alleys behind the hotel, I go alone to the beach. Bobbing on the steel-grey waters a little way offshore is a diving platform. What fun. I would go for a swim, a proper grown-up bit of exercise with a destination. I am 15 minutes into the swim when I realise the mistake I have made. The diving platform is much bigger than I had thought, which means perspective and distance have played their tricks. I have completely underestimated the length of the swim. It is a quarter of a mile from the beach, perhaps more. Currents are pulling in different directions. The waves are getting up as an evening breeze kicks in, and I am tiring quickly. But I am now closer to the platform than to the shore. I stop for a moment and tread water, looking back at the empty beach. Behind it, lights are coming on in the restaurants and bars that cluster the corniche. Life is continuing. Not a soul knows I am out here. I turn and push for the platform, and somehow, 10 minutes later, drag myself up on to it. I sit there shivering, despite the warmth of the North African winds, trying to drag air into my exhausted lungs and looking back at the beach. While I can see the people thronging the front, I can’t hear them, which means they cannot hear me. I look around for any passing boats, but there are none. I have no choice. I take a deep breath, drop off the side of the platform and push for the shore. The waves are no longer a gentle bob and heave. They are peaks and troughs that make the beach disappear from view. I try to focus on the lights, the symbols of undramatic life continuing, but they are rising and falling as I do and disappearing behind walls of water that, at their tops, shade now into a sky fading to the colour of ink. All I can do is kick. And kick. And kick again. My legs are just one long length of cramping muscle. My shoulders are sore and with every third stroke I am getting a mouthful of water. My eyes sting and a nausea – part seawater, part fear – is closing my throat. Now there are only the lights and the surf and the sea and the wind and the salt and the words, “Not like this.” Twenty minutes later, my feet drag against the sandy seabed. Now the balls of my feet are digging in. I can hear the surf breaking on the beach. I crawl the last 5ft, clawing at the sand until I am up and out of the water. I turn and, in the darkness, drop on to my arse, my back to the corniche, looking out at the platform I have come from, my arms resting on my knees. I drop my head and sob. A lot of thoughts went through my head during this experience. There was the slow-motion terror of my fight against the waves. I thought about my parents and my friends. I thought about all the things I wanted to do and hadn’t. However, not once did I think about food. Not once did I think, “If only I’d eaten properly last night” or “If I’d known this was coming, I’d have been more serious about dinner.” And afterwards I didn’t have much appetite either. A real brush with death can impact upon you in many ways. But take it from me – it doesn’t make you hungry. The bottom line is this: last suppers are a brilliant idea, but they are wasted on the very people who are eligible for them. The more I thought about this, the more it seemed to me extremely unfair. I was excluded from enjoying this blissful meal by the piffling detail of not actually being that close to death. And so I came up with a plan: I would stage my own last supper now, when I was fit and well and able to enjoy it. Because this really is the right time. While my own death may not be imminent, I have been forced in recent years to think about my mortality. This year marks my 20th anniversary as a restaurant critic. I have earned part of my living courtesy of thousands of meals, both expensive and less so. I have given my body to my job, and it hasn’t always thanked me for it. But there are upsides, too, not least the massive privilege of having food memories that stretch across years and continents: some good, some bad, some bizarre, all of them perfect material from which to construct a final meal. The long service also means one thing: I am no longer a young man. It is not simply that my beard is the colour of roadside slush mid-thaw, that I am now beyond 50 and aware there is almost certainly less to go than there has been. Both my parents are gone. There is no one else in the waiting room ahead of me. I also have that other marker of adulthood, a family. This is surely the perfect moment in which to take stock. And how better to do so than by coming up with a definitive answer to the question I have been asked, and dodged, so many times? At least this way, when the moment to take my leave actually does come, I won’t be left feeling that there’s unfinished gastronomic business. I will have done the final meal properly. Much more importantly, though, the idea presented me with the opportunity to indulge in one of the rarely discussed pleasures of the table: anticipation. Anybody with even just a passing interest in lunch will have daydreamed about what it will be, thought in detail about the process of getting the ingredients, then preparing and cooking and bringing them to the table. With my plan to build and then serve my last supper I was giving myself the licence to dream. And not only dream. I would have to test and taste and test again. I would need a main course, but also something to start. And something to finish. There would be side dishes. And bread. And butter. The right kind of butter, the stuff you can eat neat without the support of bread. And wine. Quite a lot of wine. Quite a lot of different kinds of wine. But even dreamers need rules. I realised early on that the creation of my last meal would be the coming together of all my memories, hopes and appetites, shameful or otherwise. I was not creating the perfect meal. Perfection suggests balance and poise. I had no intention of being balanced and poised. I would be bloody outrageous and over the top. I would refuse to think about consequences or the next morning, for when you eat your last supper there isn’t meant to be a next anything. In this I would be lying to myself, because of course I would live on, unless something went terribly wrong (or, depending on your point of view, terribly right). I wouldn’t even be looking for the perfect ingredients. They might turn out to be so, but only accidentally. Or because I’m burdened with exquisite taste. Happily, this journey could end only one way: with a set-piece meal surrounded by friends. It would be a major event. After all, how many dinners are there which, through each course, attempt to distil the memories of the person who organised it? Would it be a massively expanded version of Proust’s madeleine, a journey through my life one course at a time? Or would it, like the banquet at the end of La Grande Bouffe, be a complete overload of fat, salt and sugar? Would it, in short, be an obscenity? Or would it simply be dinner? Indeed, is it even possible to capture the essence of one’s life through food? The only way to find out was to start cooking. What would you have for your final meal?

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 10.12 BST The first time I tried to have sex I was 16. I knew it might hurt and that perhaps I would bleed. I was OK with that: it was part of the mythology. I imagined that, afterwards, I would stare at myself in the bathroom mirror, like the heroine in my own coming-of-age drama. As it turned out, I had to stop the sex before it properly began. An excruciating pain at the opening of my vagina shocked me into total stillness – it felt like burning and ripping at once. I was so consumed with shame that I couldn’t have looked at my reflection if I had tried. This was the first time I experienced what I now know as vulvodynia, an umbrella term for a condition characterised by chronic pain of the vulva. I was diagnosed at the age of 24, after years of being sent away from sexual health clinics with vague advice to “change positions”. According to the US’s National Vulvodynia Association, as many as 16% of women experience the condition at some point. Some have pain only during penetrative sex or when using tampons; for others, it is far more severe – their discomfort is such that they can barely sit down. The pain itself is sharp and searing, and can range from giving the same sensation as severe thrush to feeling as if something inside you has been torn. Amy*, 32, first noticed a problem when she was 14 and tried to insert a tampon. “The pain was so intense that I thought I was going to pass out.” She continued to use sanitary towels and the problem didn’t occur again until she lost her virginity at 17. “The problem stayed and never went away,” she says. She went to several doctors, none of whom had any answers. Last year, she went for a smear test. “I lay there in tears during what should have been a routine procedure.” She describes the pain as “like a red hot poker; the worst pain I’ve experienced.” She was referred to a gynaecologist and was finally diagnosed with vulvodynia. There is no commonly agreed cause of the condition, because it isn’t defined by any physical abnormality. As a result, those living with it are often misdiagnosed with recurrent thrush, referred for psychosexual counselling (which is sometimes, but not always, necessary), repeatedly tested for sexually transmitted infections, or dismissed. “Because this is a condition you can’t see objectively, it’s harder to understand,” says Dr Attam Singh, a consultant in pain medicine at the London Pain Clinic.” It’s a very small and specific specialist problem within the speciality of gynaecology.” Sue*, 51, began to experience vulval pain 12 years ago, but it was eight years before it was diagnosed properly. It started with a feeling of irritation in her genital area, especially when her legs were closed. “I was finding myself standing with my legs apart. It got so bad that I couldn’t even put on a pair of pants. I couldn’t sit down at all,” she says. “My GP, no matter how fantastic he was, had no idea, because everything looked absolutely fine.” Sue first came across the term vulvodynia on the website for Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies. “It was everything I had. My husband asked the doctor to look it up and he said: ‘I think that’s it, yes.’” Part of the problem is a lack of research. Dr David Nunns, a consultant gynaecologist at Nottingham City hospital, is one of the few experts in vulvodynia. Although the term has been around since the 1800s, it was only in the 1980s that it began to be taken seriously by the medical community. The research at that time was very much medically led, says Nunns, because there was little in the way of funding for research, but, he says: “In the last 10 years, there’s been more of a focus on a chronic-pain-management approach to the condition, which helps women to manage it.” Dr Deborah Boyle is a consultant gynaecologist at the UK’s largest vulval service, based at the Royal Free hospital in London. She says the dearth of research into vulval pain can be partly explained by the reality of “a public health system that is so strapped for cash”, but also, because vulval pain is not an urgent public health issue, research into it is hard to do. “If somebody has a pain problem, it has a massive impact on their life and their sense of self – but those consequences aren’t necessarily felt in the GP surgery or in the gynaecology service,” she says. “And when there isn’t a drug development issue, it’s harder to get anybody particularly interested, which I find quite depressing: it’s women’s quality of life.” Dr Virginia Beckett, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agrees that NHS cuts are a major factor in the lack of awareness among healthcare professionals and long diagnosis times. “The NHS is in dire straits and sexual health services are now under the control of local councils rather than NHS trusts,” she says. “The services for women’s health have been fragmented; contraceptive services are now done mainly over the phone or on the internet.” In these conditions, it is no wonder that vulval pain – a frequently mystifying problem – flies under the radar. A 2003 study in the US found that 60% of women who sought treatment for vulvodynia had seen three or more doctors, many of whom did not provide a diagnosis. “It takes an enormous amount of courage to visit a doctor and talk about such a personal issue, so to be dismissed is incredibly damaging,” says Amy. “The physical pain is one thing, but I think the emotional scars caused by years of suffering with no help, and feeling so isolated by it, have actually done the most damage.” In her 2018 memoir Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women’s Pain, Abby Norman examined gender politics and medicine. Why is it that vaginal pain is still so misunderstood? “When the definition of so-called ‘textbook cases’ have primarily been written by men, the language used becomes precedent,” she says. “We see echoes of this when the health concerns of anyone who doesn’t identify as male are dismissed or disbelieved. Women seem especially prone to being outright accused of manipulation or hysteria.” There are, however, places women like me can turn to. The Vulval Pain Society (for which Nunns is a medical adviser) is a charity that provides crucial information about many aspects of vulval pain, largely via the internet. Indeed, for many women, especially those in locations where care is difficult to access, the internet has been a godsend. The fact that I recently asked to be referred for physiotherapy was entirely down to recommendations on a Facebook group. Becki, 21, has also experienced the positive effects of online resources. She heard about “the only treatment that has helped” – the neuropathic pain medication amitriptyline, which is among the most common treatments for vulvodynia – through social media. Becki runs the Instagram account @vulvodyniasupport to stop people like us “feeling so isolated”. As with any chronic pain, vulvodynia can be alienating, with many women reporting the loss of careers or relationships. Rebecca, 33, was forced to resign from her job in HR because she was in too much pain. “I had just gone to university and was doing my postgraduate diploma, but I was just not able to stay in work,” she says. “It was pretty sad, really.” She says that discovering Facebook support groups such as Vulvodynia UK when she was feeling most alone was “a turning point … Having that community is really helpful.” And there is a growing understanding about the condition in the medical community. Beckett is optimistic about “vulva clinics that are run with a multidisciplinary approach – dermatologists and gynaecologists working together.” Boyle, whose patients travel to her clinic from all over the UK, views vulval pain as “not that difficult to treat, as long as you’ve got the right diagnosis and the specialised team of physiotherapy colleagues”. She says her work has “a cure rate in the order of 85%”. In my case, the pain persists, but I am now being treated and am receiving excellent care – although this is bittersweet, considering the years I spent suffering quietly, terrified by my body. Now, however, as vulvodynia’s profile grows, so, too, do women’s chances of receiving the treatment they need and deserve. *Names have been changed"
https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/16/sega-genesis-at-30-mega-drive-console-modern-games-industry,"In 1989, the machine the rest of the world called the Mega Drive was launched in the US with a new name and a bold new idea: that gaming could be cool Keith Stuart Fri 16 Aug 2019 11.00 BST


Last modified on Fri 16 Aug 2019 13.33 BST The US launch of the Sega Genesis, on 14 August 1989, probably didn’t seem like a huge deal outside the video game industry. The machine was launched in Japan the year before under a different name – the Mega Drive – and with a couple of decent arcade conversions, Space Harrier II and Super Thunder Blade, but not much in the way of fanfare. Nintendo utterly dominated the games business at that time, with a 95% share of the console sector and most of the biggest Japanese developers locked into exclusive deals to make games for its NES and forthcoming SNES consoles. The Mega Drive did OK in Japan but it was small fry – a cult machine. But David Rosen, who co-founded Sega after serving with the US air force in Japan during the Korean war, was determined to make a real event of the console’s launch in his native country. The first games machine with a 16-bit processor, and boasting beautiful, colourful visuals, excellent sound and enough power to handle accurate arcade conversions, it had all the credentials of a hit. All he had to do was get US gamers to recognise it. So he rebranded it Genesis – a name he thought was cool and symbolised Sega’s rebirth – and then he started building. At that time, Sega of America was basically a trading outpost; 30 staff in a small office, handling distribution and modest marketing budgets. To take things up a step, Rosen brought in Michael Katz as CEO, a combative exec with years of experience at blue-chip companies such as Colgate and Proctor & Gamble, as well as a stint at early console manufacturer Coleco. Katz immediately challenged the polite business practices of his bosses at Sega of Japan by funding a TV and print advertising campaign that set out to belittle Nintendo and its quaint, family-orientated consoles. This was just the way he’d always done things. “In my first week at Coleco I was asked to approve an ad for a game that was a direct competitor against Mattel’s Football,” he explains. “It was a wonderful ad, two guys dressed up as football players, one as Coleco Electronic Quarterback and one as Mattel Football. The two guys boast throughout the commercial, with the Coleco guy countering everything the Mattel guy says. It was the first directly competitive commercial in the games industry. But it was nothing new to me.” So Katz went for Nintendo with the advertising slogan “Genesis does what Nintendon’t”, and suddenly Sega had a new image as the brash bad boy of the industry. “I knew that for every marketing dollar I had, Nintendo had 10,” says then director of marketing Al Nilsen, who joined Sega of America when there were only three other people in the team. “You didn’t play video games back then, you played Nintendo. Sega was an afterthought. We couldn’t go after their core audience: children. Peter Main, their head of marketing basically said, just get the six to 12 year olds, that’s all we need. “So I looked at what we had that Nintendo didn’t and it was our arcade heritage. Golden Axe, Space Harrier – these were Sega classics, and the Genesis system was the first console that could bring that arcade experience home. I looked at who was playing in the arcades – and this was back in the day, when they were on every street corner – and it wasn’t six to 12-year-old boys, it was teenagers and young adults. They went there because that’s where the best games were. And that’s also where the girls were. I said: ‘This is my market’”. So Sega went straight for the teenagers with aggressive, rock music-driven, jump cut-filled TV ads, initally produced by slick PR and advertising agency Bozell, and later by Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, who masterminded the “Welcome to the Next Level” TV commercials and would go on to make the famed “Got Milk” campaign. But Katz knew if the Genesis was really going to rule in the US, it needed something else: celebrity endorsement. This became another vital focus. “When I got to Sega, we needed hot licensed software with names that consumers would recognise,” he says. “If we could get that, we’d be able to compete with Nintendo. So I said let’s go after personalities. Let’s go after the hottest athlete in the States – that was Joe Montana – then we’d extend that to boxing and everything else.” The eventual result was Joe Montana Football from Electronic Arts, a huge hit that spawned several sequels. “We didn’t realise we were competing with Nintendo for Montana,” says Katz. “We beat them out by a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and after that I discovered I’d been bidding against [Nintendo of America chairman] Howard Lincoln. That was gratifying – it signalled that we were beginning to gain traction.” Also vital to the success of the Genesis was Sega of America’s determination to bring US developers on to the console. There was an understanding that they wouldn’t beat the Super Nintendo with arcade conversions alone – they needed local talent. So they approached US studios such as Accolade, Spectrum Holobyte and, of course, Electronic Arts to support the console. “Sega were always going to make a good job of bringing over their arcade games, but the total product offering was narrow,” says EA founder Trip Hawkins. “The 16-bit market was new and a lot of developers had come to understand how much more they could do with it. We really pushed the envelope and explored genres that others weren’t really willing to try at the time – sports simulations being the most pervasive example, but then there was true innovation. Populous invented a new genre.” The Sega Genesis didn’t just make games cool, it changed how consoles were marketed, and widened the scope of console game development beyond Japanese powerhouses such as Nintendo, Capcom, Konami and Taito. There was a slightly combative relationship between Sega of Japan and Sega of America, and this led to a richly creative period of development, culminating in the arrival of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Japanese character infused with the bombastic qualities of 1990s US pop culture. Launched in the US more than a year before the Super Nintendo system, the Genesis came out of nowhere to become the biggest-selling machine in the country. We look back now and it seems like Sega had preternatural confidence in its vision but in fact, as is often the case in the games industry, it was winging it. “I was just trying to establish a toehold for Genesis in the US,” says Nilsen. “I didn’t have the software to be an aspirational machine – I launched with five titles! By 1990, I had maybe 30 titles and some third-party games. If you’d asked me in 1989, ‘Will Sega have the No 1 selling console in America?’ it never even entered my mind. I shouldn’t say that though, because when I was out talking to prospective partners that’s exactly what I was telling them. Did I believe it? No.” • This article was based on interviews conducted while researching the book Sega Mega Drive: The Collected Works, published by Read-Only Memory."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 20.38 BST In anticipation of its new season, Saturday Night Live just announced a return date of 28 September, while also unveiling the first round of guest hosts and musical performers including Woody Harrelson, Billie Ellish, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Taylor Swift, Kristen Stewart and Eddie Murphy. Exciting a line-up as that is, viewer anticipation is likely tempered due to the quality of the show’s previous season, which was largely underwhelming and contained a number of true low points. To be sure, season 44 also had its share of highs, but it’s undeniable that SNL has struggled in recent years. Still, that’s no reason to write off season 45 just yet; the show can turn things around by following a couple of important leads from last year and making a few crucial changes. As the 2020 primaries continue to ramp up, Saturday Night Live has its work cut out, especially when it comes to its cold opens. With only a couple of exceptions, these were routinely the worst part of last season, as the writers seemed content to merely reference whatever political talking point was making the rounds that week without offering any insight or even much in the way of original jokes. This laziness extended to stories with ready-made setups, such as Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings or Michael Cohen’s testimony to Congress, all of which coasted on mediocre celebrity impersonations that fizzled from memory as soon as “Live from New York...” was uttered. Meanwhile, slower news weeks saw scattered Fox News or Meet the Press segments rush through a handful of topics with zero focus. Tied as they are to the current moment, cold opens rarely age well, but even taking that into account, we expect better than the likes of the cringe-worthy Deal or No Deal/hamburders sketch. If SNL hopes to remain culturally relevant for the new election cycle, they really need to step up their political comedy in general. Key to that is the need to … There is a case to be made that Alec Baldwin is one of our greatest living comic actors, his long history with Saturday Night Live being a big part of the argument. That said, his portrayal of Donald Trump these past two seasons has been nothing short of embarrassing, his initially brutal impression during the 2016 primaries morphing into the most insufferable recurring character on the show. Worse still, it’s an almost entirely toothless portrait, in spite of Baldwin and the writers’ clear disdain for the President. As was the case with Will Ferrell’s interpretation of George W Bush, Baldwin makes Trump into such a harmless bozo as to makes him almost lovable – or at least, he might be lovable if Baldwin wasn’t mugging the entire time. At this point it’s clear no parody can match Trump (or for that matter, our political landscape as a whole). Nevertheless, this particular one has run its course, something Baldwin himself seems aware of. He’s said he won’t be returning to the role for this season, and though that has yet to be confirmed, let’s hope it’s true. Speaking of someone overstaying their welcome, let’s also hope season 45 involves … This is probably something we don’t have to worry about, given it’s unlikely Davidson will be in the public eye as much now that his whirlwind/broken engagement to Ariana Grande is well behind us. But while it’s entirely reasonable to expect the comedian to use his personal life as fodder for his own material – including regular turns on Weekend Update – the show relied on it far too much during the first half of last season, to the point where it often felt like we were watching The Pete Davidson Show, featuring the Cast of SNL and Special Guests. Davidson is a divisive screen presence to begin with, and while I’m not suggesting he necessarily be used sparingly, his personal life should be, especially since all the attention resulted in a troubling public cry for help and subsequent on-set wellness check by police. For the guy’s own wellbeing and peace of mind, let’s let him do his job and be a regular cast member. On the topic of public controversies involving Pete Davidson, one thing the show absolutely must do is … The most infuriating moment of last season and one of the all-time great embarrassments in its history – was the on-air apology issued by Davidson, on behalf of SNL, to Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw over a quick joke about his appearance during a prior Weekend Update segment. You can argue that the joke itself was in poor taste, but if SNL is going to start handing out apologies to people on that front, there are others far more deserving of one than the representative from Texas. Even worse than the apology was the way the show brought out Crenshaw and let him get in a few comeback jabs of his own, before allotting him time to spout a dopey – and insincere – appeal towards mutual respect in the face of political differences. Satire requires the satirist to have a backbone, and while SNL’s days as a counterculture staple are far behind it, the show loses all credibility by kowtowing to conservative’s faux-outrage and platforming the likes of Crenshaw. Moving on to less controversial matters, one thing to show needs to do is… Adam Driver’s insane Career Day sketch from last season’s premiere was one of the most hilarious and endlessly rewatchable in years. Along with other standouts like the Weezer sketch and The War in Words, it served to remind us that Saturday Night Live is at its best not when it’s trying to be politically or culturally relevant, but when it goes all in on idiosyncrasy and absurdism. This works especially well with hosts known for their serious and dramatic personae, such as Adam Driver, Claire Foy and Liev Schreiber, all of whom turned top-notch work last season by going weird. One final thing the show could do to turn things around next year is … So, yeah, there’s a less-than-zero chance of this happening, given that Update co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che are also the head writers. But Weekend Update is supposed to be the centerpiece of Saturday Night Live, something we look forward to every week. For that to work, we need a host or hosts with personality and chemistry. Close as they appear to be behind the scenes, Jost and Che have neither, coming off at most as smug and bored respectively, and merely tolerable of one another. This state of affairs might be more tolerable to us if the material they give themselves was stronger, but alas, that’s not the case. Since Jost and Che are not going to up and relinquish their roles as Update hosts, they could at least need to conduct themselves outside of the show with a bit more dignity. It’s hard to have much faith about the direction of Saturday Night Live when its head writers pitch a fit over legitimate criticism. With all of this said, we know that the historical map of Saturday Night Live is filled with peaks and valleys, which is enough to give us hope that season 45 rises to the occasion."

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 18.47 BST Nairo Quintana made an early statement at the Vuelta a España with a powerful ride to win Stage 2 in Calpe as Ireland’s Nicolas Roche took the overall leader’s jersey. A select group of riders including Rigoberto Urán (EF Pro Cycling) and Primoz Roglic (Jumbo-Visma) attacked 20km from the finish of the 199.6km stage in the town on Spain’s Mediterranean coast and the Movistar Team’s Colombian climber, who won the Vuelta’s general classification in 2016, was able to prevail. The previous race leader, Miguel Ángel López of the Astana Pro Team, who had won Saturday’s team time-trial opening stage, gave chase but the front group, which also included Mikel Nieve (Mitchelton-SCOTT) and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates) proved too strong to be caught. Quintana then distanced his stage rivals to win by five seconds from a charging Roche of Team Sunweb, who took the red leader’s jersey by two seconds on a count-back of bonus seconds. Roglic was third. Roche and Team Sunweb will attempt to defend the red jersey on Monday’s Stage 3, a 188km trip from Ibi to Alicante, with two category-three climbs along the route."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.04 BST The 2019 VMAs often didn’t seem to know what year it was – a mix of dad jokes, Latin music, double-denim outfits and one performance set in 2079, in a ceremony that mostly lacked the typical controversy. With awards split between longtime pop dominator Taylor Swift and the very 2019 star Lil Nas X, it was perhaps fitting that the night’s top honor celebrated the genre- and era-defying musical work of Missy Elliott. Swift opened the show with two singles from her new album Lover: the technicolor trailer park-themed You Need To Calm Down, and return-to-form acoustic track Lover. The colorful performance kicked off a big night for Swift, who took home video of the year for You Need To Calm Down: a song pitched as an LGBTQ anthem for Pride month. In her acceptance speech, she pointed to the Equality Act, for which the video solicited petitions. “By voting for this video, you showed that you want a world where everyone is treated equally,” she said. Swift also took home the trophy for the “video for good” category. The night’s other major winner was Lil Nas X, whose genre-smashing hit Old Town Road spent a record-breaking 19 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, and took home the award for song of the year. “This is my first award ever,” he said as he unrolled a person-sized scroll as his “speech” – causing Lizzo to nearly drop her diamond-encrusted tequila. After the notable no-shows of 2018’s event, this year’s VMAs went deep on the talent bench, with performances from newer acts such as HER alongside veterans including Miley Cyrus, who performed Slide Away – a song released earlier this month, just days after news broke of her split from Liam Hemsworth. The music largely overshadowed Sebastian Maniscalco, a 36-year-old Italian American comedian who hosted the event after last year’s VMAs went without a host. Following a muted introduction seemingly aimed at the dads – in which he admonished the kids to put away their phones, joked about MTV offering a “safe space” (“If you feel triggered or offended they’re providing a safe space backstage where you’ll get some stress balls and a blankie,” he said), and ensured everyone knew there were no participation trophies – Maniscalco was largely quiet for the rest of the night. The MTV Video Music Award ceremony (VMAs) are an annual award show for music promo videos run by the music cable channel in the US. First held in 1984, as well as an award for the overall best video, there are awards in various music genre and for technical aspects of video production. Over the years the award show has seen several notable controversies, including in 2015 when Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus clashed on stage, and in 2009 when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift receiving her award to declare that 'Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time'"". To date the most successful artists in VMAs history are Beyoncé with 24 wins, Madonna with 20, and Lady Gaga and Peter Gabriel with 13 each. Gabriel set the record for the most wins in one night, when in 1987 the video for Sledgehammer won 9 awards, and Gabriel also picked up an award as a video pioneer. Instead, the spotlight belonged to Missy Elliott, who received the Michael Jackson video vanguard award. She earned the loudest cheers of the night and a standing ovation for her performance of hits – including Supa Dupa Fly, Get Ur Freak On, Work It and Lose Control – which was, in the words of presenter Cardi B, “FIRE!”. “Nobody deserves to be the video vanguard more than Missy,” Cardi B said in an introduction for Elliott that highlighted the Virginia native’s influence on songwriting, fashion and, of course, music videos. In her acceptance speech, Elliott was visibly emotional: “I have worked diligently for over two decades and I never thought I would be standing up here receiving this award,” she said . She name-checked her video influences (Busta Rhymes, Janet Jackson, Peter Gabriel and Madonna), offered a tribute to Aaliyah (who died 18 years ago on Sunday) and celebrated “the dance community all around the world”. “This is the next generation,” she said, bringing out her youngest dancers, “and I promise y’all – I love y’all with all my heart.” Despite the choice of host, the next generation emerged as a theme of the night, with several performances illustrating the dominant global, meme-able, Spanish-seeking forces in music. Barcelona native Rosalia performed in Spanish, and took home the award for best Latin video; Colombia native J. Balvin and Bad Bunny, of Puerto Rico, performed their hit Qué Pretendes in a 3D-accentuated emoji playland; and former Fifth Harmony member Normani had a breakout performance of her dance showcase single Motivation. In a nod to the feverish coverage of their summer romance, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello performed a teasing, nose-to-nose rendition of their duet Señorita. The couple topped favorites Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus for best collaboration. Other winners included Jonas Brother’s Sucker for best pop, Cardi B’s Money for best rap, Billie Eilish for best new artist and an absent Ariana Grande for best artist. In the end, the final star of the night was New Jersey, the oft-second fiddle to New York which hosted the VMAs for the first time. In what frontman Joe Jonas called a “Jersey dream”, the Jonas Brothers – originally from Wyckoff, New Jersey – received their award from three stars of the Sopranos; and the show closed with a tour of the state’s contributions to hip-hop, featuring New Jersey natives Ice-T (born in Newark), Fetty Wap, Naughty by Nature, Wyclef Jean, Lords of the Underground, Redman and Queen Latifah."

Get the mushroom mixture almost ready before you start to cook the beans, giving plenty of time for the shallots, garlic and mushrooms to cook. If you wish, you can cook the beans earlier, drain and plunge them into iced water, then reheat them with the mushrooms at the last minute. I suggest green beans, but this would look beautiful with yellow beans, too. And it is a good one for runner beans, cut thinly on the diagonal. You could swap the beans for courgettes, in which case I like to cut them into thick matchsticks, then either dust them lightly with flour and fry them in olive oil or steam them in a colander over boiling water until just tender and translucent, then toss them with the sautéed shallots and mushrooms.

https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/26/data-and-the-dress-what-christopher-wylie-can-teach-fashion,"Big data can help high street retailers maximise profits, but it also has the potential to improve sustainability. Should the consumer be worried about how their information is being used? David Styles Mon 26 Aug 2019 06.00 BST There is plenty for the modern fashion lover to be concerned about. As if trying to juggle your finances with choosing responsibly made clothes wasn’t tricky enough, a new ethical threat looms over the industry: data privacy. In the age of fast fashion – where online retailers such as Boohoo and Missguided can offer tops for a tenner and £1 bikinis – high-street retailers are fighting to keep their prices competitive by maximising what they know about their shoppers. This is only made possible, however, by gathering vast amounts of consumer data. The sales boost delivered by harvesting intelligence on buying and browsing habits was perfectly illustrated in a 2018 McKinsey & Co report. In it, 35% of Amazon’s mammoth global sales were attributed to personalisation strategies. This technique sees retailers collate all the information amassed on registered users to ensure marketing emails and adverts are perfectly tailored to tempt customers to spending as frequently as possible. Big names on the high street are starting to take note. Consumer data can be used to predict how many clothes each shopper will buy, meaning companies will be able to minimise waste, making them less likely to incinerate garments in the future. This is technology that H&M is planning to leverage in order to better forecast future collections. It has first-hand experience of what happens when that is done badly: in 2017, it incinerated millions of dollars’ worth of stock before it ever reached a shop floor. While the retailer claimed the clothes were unsellable for safety reasons, the speculation was that the decision was taken simply because the items were never going to sell. It was an environmental nightmare, a PR disaster for the brand and a massive waste of money. In theory, for a global company such as H&M, avoiding a repeat performance could help to maximise profits – and deliver sweeping sustainability gains. To get the most out of its new venture, H&M assembled a team of experts in the fields of data analytics and artificial intelligence. One such data tsar is Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who has been hired in a consultancy role. Upon his appointment, he explained: “We can’t help people if we don’t know who they are. With the use of data, we can make sure our customers get what they want.” But consumers can already get exactly what they want, they just have to shop around to get it. The real task facing Wylie and the newly formed team is to ensure H&M knows what customers want before their high street rivals do. While it may seem revolutionary, H&M’s work represents the tip of the iceberg. Google Cloud recently unveiled an unprecedented partnership with Stella McCartney that will see the tech giant gather and process huge quantities of data from the luxury brand’s supply chain. This, to start with, will focus on the use of resources such as water in producing materials such as cotton, but the possibilities of Google Cloud’s data processing are broader: if applied to sales, brands may be able to respond on an almost daily basis to changing customer desires rather than waiting months to plan future collections. This could be a hugely powerful tool in a fashion industry with ever shortening lead times. While taking a data-heavy approach seems a no-brainer for brands and retailers, consumer appetite for handing over yet more data is understandably mixed – at the thin end of the wedge, who hasn’t grown tired of the incessant requests for email addresses at the checkout? A recent report by market insights specialist Retail Economics claims that while the fashion industry is entering a “seminal decade” in which artificial intelligence and digital traceability will be “fully implemented”, 67% of people do not trust retailers to act responsibly and protect their data. Additionally, half of those surveyed were unwilling to share personal data such as body shape, weight or height to enhance product recommendation accuracy – one of the ideas floated by H&M. And fears aren’t soothed by attitudes in Westminster. Britain’s new prime minister has consistently voted in favour of “mass surveillance of people’s communications and activities”, offering little comfort for those worrying about data privacy. Consumer scepticism is well placed, according to Lauren Vargas, a digital fellow at the University of Leicester. A specialist in the application of artificial intelligence, Vargas believes the public should be “wary of all companies – regardless of size – collecting and using their data. People need to take responsibility, to be aware of what information they are giving away and what they may be sacrificing in return for their information.” Your favourite fashion haunt almost certainly stores your name, age, address, email, bank details and style preferences – and they may well soon have built up a picture of your body shape and size, in addition to knowing what days and times you tend to shop. But who really wants Topshop knowing more about you than your friends and family do? Building consumer confidence will be vital for these brands investing in the use of big data analytics. Google Cloud UK’s head of customer engineering, Ian Pattison, acknowledges the need to “govern and curate the data carefully”, but also believes “what each individual retailer and brand does with that [information] is entirely up to them”. He has also stated the company is looking to work with as many fashion brands as possible.Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, believes that “if retailers and brands cannot build enough trust to capture sufficient shopper information … then the deeper engagements that will help retail experiences thrive over the next decade will be undermined.”"

But nowhere have recent demonstrations resonated more than Hong Kong, where weeks of street clashes have been triggered by the government’s attempt to introduce a controversial extradition bill. With protests deadlocked almost three months on, our Beijing correspondent Lily Kuo asks whether resolution is likely to come by peaceful means – or from the iron fist of China. When Mauricio Macri became Argentina’s president in 2015, it was meant to signal the country’s economic rehabilitation after years of catastrophe. Yet four years later, poverty levels are higher than when he took office and the spectre of 2001, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt, haunts Argentina once again. As former president Cristina Kirchner mounts a political comeback, Buenos Aires correspondent Uki Goñi asks how the country finds itself in such a sorry state again. The US women’s footballer Megan Rapinoe became an overnight global sensation when she rejected Donald Trump’s invitation to visit Washington during her team’s victorious World Cup campaign. It wasn’t just the gloriously indelicate manner of her refusal – “I’m not going to the fucking White House” – but her unapologetically proud demeanour as a gay, successful woman that captured the world’s attention.

Last modified on Thu 22 Aug 2019 10.26 BST When Tim Fischer, who has died aged 73, announced just after question time on 30 June 1999 that he was quitting as the deputy prime minister of Australia to be more present in the lives of his two young sons, the reaction was unusually sentimental. Sustained applause broke out in the House at the conclusion of Fischer’s farewell, and the standing ovation extended for more than a minute. Journalists also stood in the gallery above the bear pit and applauded as a mark of respect, and possibly contrition, given his rise to the Nationals leadership had been treated derisively by many commentators. During his farewell at the dispatch box, Fischer had cocked an eyebrow at the correspondents and observed: “To the media I would say this. It was about 12 months ago that you stopped calling me idiosyncratic. I knew then it was time to start thinking about getting out of politics.” Shutting Australia off from the rest of the world behind a protectionist barrier is just plain dumb The respect from around the chamber was a collective acknowledgement that Fischer had not taken the easy road during his public service. He had stood with John Howard during the tumultuous times that followed the Coalition’s ascension to power in Canberra in 1996 – navigating both the gun control debate that followed the Port Arthur massacre, which caused significant grief in the bush, and the rise of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party, a disruption to the political landscape that threatened the hegemony of the junior Coalition partner. Fischer’s biographer, Peter Rees, noted: “Never once had Fischer dropped the ball on populism.” The departure wasn’t a complete shock. Fischer told the Nine Network in the same month he called time on his leadership that 1998 had been the worst of his 28 years in public life because “we had to deal out the left and the extreme right”. The battle with One Nation had been enervating, and Fischer felt he was needed at home. His son Harrison had been diagnosed with autism. When Fischer resolved it was time to go to the backbench before leaving politics, after an Apec meeting in Auckland, he informed his close colleagues of his intentions. On the plane ride back to Australia he shared the news with the then Australian Financial Review journalist Brendan Pearson on the basis he would not report the development until the deputy prime minister informed the House. According to Rees’s account of events, confiding in Pearson proved useful to Fischer when Howard tried to persuade him on his return to Canberra to delay the announcement. The Nationals leader told Howard the die was cast. There would be no delay. Timothy Andrew Fischer was a singular political character. He was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, in rural New South Wales. Educated in Melbourne, he served in the army during the Vietnam war before returning to settle in Boree Creek in the Riverina. He went into politics in 1971, first in the NSW state parliament, moving to the federal arena in 1984. He married Judy Brewer later in life, in 1992, and the couple had two sons. Fischer rounded out his professional life as a tourism executive and with an ambassadorial appointment to the Vatican. Fischer was a lifelong railway enthusiast. In his book Steam Locomotives That Galvanised the Nation, Fischer recounts an episode of trainspotting, aged 10, on the Newell Highway over bridge near the Narrandera railway station. His experience of bearing witness is almost rhapsodic. “My thoughts that morning were fully engaged by the brilliant colour, action and movement of the big black steam locomotive hauling some rust red carriages with gold trimmings.” Closer to home, the contact with trains was more prosaic. The young Tim would accompany his father on Monday nights just after 7pm to collect the Sydney Sunday papers that arrived with passengers on the CPH rail motor. But even that small element of routine burned bright in recollection. “What joy as the rail motor with its big searching headlight came sweeping around the corner in winter; a quick whistle stop, and then off it would hurtle into the night.” Trains assumed importance because they were part of the way Fischer encountered the world. Young Tim rode the train to boarding school in Melbourne, battling intense homesickness as the non-sporty chess player struggled to find his tribe at Xavier College. He rode troop trains in the army, and back in the Riverina he loaded sheep and grain and unloaded superphosphate from freight trains. Fischer said he was never a trainspotter in the “classic British sense” but his lifelong fascination stemmed from wanting to understand the role trains, both passenger and freight, played in the development of modern economies. In some of his writing, Fischer processes the passage of time and societal change by reflecting on the pre-war Australian prime ministers who rode trains, changing transport at state borders because of different gauges, through to his own career navigating the journeys to the parliament in Sydney and in Canberra. During his political career, Fischer made a point of visiting railway stations from Pretoria to Tehran to “get a feel for the standard of living and quality of infrastructure in countries off the beaten track”. During his diplomatic appointment at the Holy See, Fisher contributed to the the Caritas Express – a steam train journey from the Vatican Gardens to Tuscany. Fischer, an imposing physical presence, decked out in an Akubra, with a speaking style possessing the mild echo of a childhood speech impediment, was underestimated by many prominent Canberra commentators when he took the Nationals leadership federally in 1990. The acerbic political commentator Alan Ramsey declared in his inimitable fashion that Fisher was the first dingbat ever to lead the National party. Fischer’s politics were a mixed bag. John Hewson took the trade ministry away from the Nationals during the Fightback period, and Fischer was dogged until he grabbed it back from the Liberals. Unusually for a National of his period, Fischer wasn’t a protectionist, he was an internationalist, and broadly comfortable with the economic rationalism of the Liberal party. Rees notes in his biography Fischer believed rural Australia had to evolve with the times or it would be squeezed out of international markets. In 1996 he told his party’s national conference, “shutting Australia off from the rest of the world behind a protectionist barrier – trade and human – is just plain dumb”. The devout Catholic was socially conservative, and fiercely opposed to gay rights during his time in politics. Fischer was criticised during the Wik and Mabo debates for forcefully taking up the objections of pastoral leaseholders to Indigenous land rights, but while his positions in that debate were contentious, he stood firmly against racism. Divisive, dumb and wrong He spoke out against Hansonism, labelling her interventions on race “divisive, dumb and wrong”. Fischer, who took on Hanson more forcefully than John Howard, was the only government minister to sign up to the parliamentary code of race ethics championed by Labor and the Australian Democrats. He was also interested in forging closer relationships between Australia and Asia, and during his service in the trade portfolio built up a substantial network of political friends and allies in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. He was also a critic of Israel’s aggression against Lebanon, which caused friction with Liberals. The gun control debate was enormously difficult for Fischer and the Nationals. The then deputy prime minister stood shoulder to shoulder with Howard in championing regulation after Port Arthur, but there was a fierce backlash in the bush, and there was an open rebellion inside the Nationals, with Fischer under intense pressure from Queensland MPs, including De-Anne Kelly and Bob Katter (who parted ways with the Nationals in 2001). His leadership faced an acute threat. Some of the ugly rallies against gun control included effigies of Fischer. The deputy prime minister told protesters at a rally in Gympie gun control was “about taking out of the suburbs of Australia the semi-automatics and automatics that should not be in the suburbs of Australia”. As the protesters hurled abuse, a teenage girl took the stage with Fischer to back the deputy prime minister’s stand. The then federal Labor leader Kim Beazley later reflected Fischer could have chosen to allow the Nationals to differentiate themselves from the Liberals in the gun debate because Labor supported the regulations Howard implemented, so Nationals numbers weren’t required to get the changes legislated. “It would have passed this House very easily without the support of your National party members,” Beazley said in the chamber. “But you chose not that easy road out. You chose to lay your leadership on the line and persist in a course of action which was right for the country.” Fischer, who died of cancer, is survived by his wife, Judy, and his sons, Harrison and Dominic. • Tim Fischer, Australian politician, born 3 May 1946; died 22 August 2019"

Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill Fri 16 Aug 2019 13.00 BST


Last modified on Fri 16 Aug 2019 13.30 BST Sue Stennett lives with her husband in Lincolnshire. She travels to Manchester whenever she can in search of more information about the Peterloo massacre and why it inspired her great-great-great-grandfather to found the Manchester Guardian – the name of this paper until 1959 For my wedding, my aunt gave me a veil, and I was told the story behind it, and how John Edward Taylor’s daughter Sophia had worn it on her wedding day. It was cream, and I chose a dress to match. I was so young at the time, and didn’t really appreciate the significance of its story – it was only after my father died that my interest was sparked. I found a book in among his things called A Family Biography – a limited-edition book collated by Catherine and Isabella Scott (Sophie’s nieces and the sisters of the Guardian editor CP Scott). He was a cotton merchant in Manchester and a moderate reformer at a time when change and unrest were sweeping across Europe. He himself was well-to-do but he was hugely engaged with the plight of the working class. It had not been a long time since the French revolution and with ripples of unrest being felt in Britain too, reform was badly needed. There had been protests and riots across the north of England – such as the 1817 Blanket March, in which a large group planned to march from Manchester to London with blankets to keep them warm, but were quickly dispersed by the authorities. Habeas Corpus had been suspended for a year, and spying, alongside unofficial, underground movements, was rife. John felt passionately that something radical needed to happen to create change. He was radicalised by what he saw at Peterloo. He was at St Peter’s Field on the day of the massacre and interviewed eyewitnesses. He discovered that John Tyas of the Times, the only reporter from a national newspaper at the meeting, had been arrested and imprisoned. Taylor feared this was an attempt by the government to suppress news of the event and wanted to present the story from the people’s perspective. He was careful to be balanced – to show that those involved were not all drunk hooligans looking to stir up trouble, but rather a collection of people deeply dissatisfied with the inequality in society who had arrived in the city centre that day in the hope of peaceful protest. He wrote: I affirm, from actual observation, that not the slightest breach of the peace had been committed, or appeared, as far as I can judge, likely to take place… He went on to collate lists of the injured and wounded – something that was unrecorded, and had been estimated inaccurately because many were reluctant to seek medical help. He wrote a more detailed account called “Notes and Observations on the papers relative to the internal state of the country”, which went to parliament and contradicted the official record, and was one of the thousands who signed the declaration which asserted the peaceful character of the protest. In the aftermath of the massacre, things began to improve economically and pressure increased for social reform. In 1832 the Great Reform Act introduced wide-ranging changes to the electoral system of England and Wales. He came from a Unitarian background, where a core belief was that people come to salvation through education. In this context, what he witnessed at Peterloo, and in its aftermath, galvanised in him a belief that education in the form of balanced, honest, well-researched reporting could be the spark for renewed hope. He teamed up with 11 liberal-minded textile owners from Manchester to finance the venture, at a cost of £1,050. The first four-page edition of the Manchester Guardian appeared on Saturday 5 May 1821 and cost 7d. Like all newspapers based outside London, they could only afford to publish once a week, but it wasn’t long before the introduction of the railways enabled wide and fast distribution of newspapers, making them accessible for the masses. I can see why my great-aunt referred to the early Manchester Guardian as “the family firm” – like most media outlets of the day, there was a degree of nepotism within the staff. After Taylor’s untimely death in 1844, his colleague Jeremiah Garnett took on the editorship. It was later taken over by John Taylor, the son of John Edward Taylor, and then his cousin, the famous CP Scott, whose tenure as editor was lengthy, formative and highly celebrated. He wrote the Guardian’s landmark 1921 centenary essay, made it his mission to revive the early radicalism of the founders, and began to call on his staff to carry out in-depth investigations into social problems. Today, despite the large numbers of people who read the Guardian, few seem to know about its roots, and how they inform its journalism today. For many years in the aftermath of Peterloo, governments didn’t want the story to be told, but with Mike Leigh’s recent film and increased efforts by the people of Manchester, it seems to finally be getting the exposure it deserves. In my opinion, there is more division in society now than ever, and the founding principles which have guided the Guardian’s work have never been so vital. It remains committed to unbiased, honest reporting which can offer truth and hope. The older I get, and the more people I encounter, the more important I feel this is. We think we’ve moved on from the 19th century, but many of the same challenges are still central to society. But history has shown that protest works. It can change things, slowly but surely, and it can take many different forms."
https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/25/don-quixote-bolshoi-ballet-review-royal-opera-house,"Royal Opera House, LondonThe Bolshoi’s London residency concludes with more breathtaking old-school brilliance Sarah Crompton Sun 25 Aug 2019 08.00 BST The dancers of the Bolshoi Ballet have packed up their London base and gone home to Moscow, leaving behind them a lingering perfume of ballet performed at the highest level. Other companies worry about relevance, about appealing to a broad audience, about making work that speaks to the modern age. Then there’s the Bolshoi. It has some contemporary work in its repertory but mainly it just exists in a place called Balletworld, where costumes are garish, stories are big, and where the dancing is of such pure, bravura brilliance that it makes the heart sing. Don Quixote, first choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1869 and adapted by Alexander Gorsky in 1902, is a throwback to the time when spectacle was all. It’s got a completely silly plot where the wanderings of Cervantes’s deluded knight and his mate Sancho Panza are wound into the slim story of the vivacious Kitri and her poor barber lover, Basilio, trying to get married against her innkeeper father’s wishes. The action grinds to a halt repeatedly so people can show off their dancing skills, both in grand classical variations and in character dances that summon the atmosphere of Spain through the filter of Petipa’s classical instincts. The action grinds to a halt repeatedly so people can show off their dancing skills Alexei Fadeyechev’s production, first seen in 2016, makes the tale set to a cheery score by Minkus come up as fresh as new paint. It has the virtue of bright set designs from Valery Leventhal, and particularly the costume designs by Elena Zaitseva, that take us from a market square via a Gypsy encampment and a bonkers vision scene to the court of a noble 17th-century Duke, with scant regard for period detail but an effective eye for colour and flounce. The combination of subtle mauve and deep red lining in the costume of the sultry flamenco dancer Mercedes, and the staggering greens, reds and yellows in the Gypsy girl’s skirts are breathtaking in themselves, never mind the impassioned dancing of Kristina Karasyova and Anna Balukova bringing them to vivid life. All the dancers throw themselves into their roles with belief and care, making the steps sing. There is none of the easy naturalism that characterises the Royal Ballet’s version. Solos are always greeted by a stylised wafting of fans and waving of arms that pushes the attention centre stage. But the Bolshoi has so absorbed this crowd-pleaser into its collective body that the vitality springs from the way they perform; it’s not that they act so much as embody a style that in turn creates broad brushes of character. On the opening night of the run, Margarita Shrainer, still a first soloist, seemed at first nervous in the demanding role of Kitri. She performed all the steps perfectly – the light jumps, the rapid turns – but appeared tense and anxious. Yet as the evening progressed, you could see her confidence rise; by the third act, where Kitri is just showing off, Shrainer was throwing off pirouettes so fast that her body seemed to blur. She makes beautiful arcs with her upper body too, shaping each jump. In the pastel-hued vision scene, she is gracious and serene (as was the striking Antonina Chapkina, as a chilly but beautiful Queen of the Dryads.) Shrainer was much assisted by her Basilio, Igor Tsvirko, full of charm and panache. He’s a slim, light dancer who positively flies, but he’s also incredibly strong, a safe and courteous partner. The moments where he lifts his love high in the air on one hand were, quite literally, show-stopping, and their third act pas de deux was so stupendously exciting that it was impossible not to be swept away. Balletland is a very genial place to live sometimes."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.30 BST On Clare’s first day at work 22 years ago, Ryan was the first person she was introduced to. They were at the Mars confectionery company, in the wrapping area of the factory that made Twix bars. Clare was 24; Ryan was 20. “He’s 6ft 3in, dark and handsome,” she says. The head-to-toe white overalls look good on men, she adds. “I thought: ‘Wow!’ straight away. But I was at work and I thought: ‘I’m here to do a job, not find my potential husband.’” Did Ryan notice her? “It’s a very male-dominated area, and seeing a young lady walk into the factory, and especially one so pretty, yeah, it was a big day. I remember being taken aback at how beautiful she was.” Clare smiles. “I don’t remember you saying that.” Although they were part of a friendly, close-knit team, the couple found it hard to get time together. Their break times rarely coincided. On top of that, Clare says her factory outfit – hairnet, hard hat, steel-toe-capped boots, white overalls – was not the most flattering. “I had to do my best every day to look as good as I possibly could,” she says. “My eyebrows would be done, although I couldn’t wear too much makeup.” She says he was oblivious to the fact she liked him. “I would try to engineer it so we were on the same break pattern, and I’d try to organise lots of social events,” she says. Did he like her? “I did,” says Ryan. “But I’m not a very macho, chase-the-ladies sort of person.” It took about six months of Clare “being quite underhand”, she says, before they got together on a night out, and Ryan says they have been pretty much inseparable ever since. They moved in together six months later and worked together on the factory floor for another two years. “You spend a lot of time with those people who are working the same shifts as you,” says Ryan. “It was young love and we didn’t want that space – we were quite happy spending all our time together.” What did they like about each other? “The most important thing is our sense of humour is the same,” says Ryan. And their values, Clare adds. At work “you find a lot of people who share the same values. I think that was the thing that has kept us together, and at work as well – it feels like it’s all wrapped up in our life.” They are both still at Mars, a company they love, where employees are called Martians. Clare did a degree and now works in marketing; Ryan is in factory planning. “There are days when I won’t see him at all, and there are days when I’ll see him in the canteen,” she says. “It never really gets too much.” And they rarely talk about work at home, he says. Do they eat chocolate all day? Ryan laughs and says he has type 1 diabetes, so has to watch his sugar intake. Working in a chocolate factory does have its advantages, however. “I’ve had a couple of low blood-sugar attacks, and chocolate is one of the things you can use to fight them.’” Their house is a magnet for trick or treaters at Halloween, says Clare. Is she surprised that she and Ryan are still together, more than two decades on? “It sounds so trite, but when you know, you know,” she says. “My dad used to say: ‘You and Ryan are cut from the same cloth.’” A few weeks ago, Ryan’s aunt died. She got Ryan the job at Mars, and worked for the company for a remarkable 73 years. They were close. “I was trying to be strong for my dad, keep a stiff upper lip, and then at the end when everyone was filtering out after the funeral, Clare came to see me and I broke down,” he says, “because it was Clare. She’s my person, the one I share everything with. You know that person means everything to you.” Want to share your story?

Last modified on Thu 22 Aug 2019 15.55 BST First there was the baby shower, then came the gender-reveal party. Now parents-to-be are embarking on a new way of celebrating imminent parenthood: the “mother blessing”. Unlike other baby events, where the emphasis is on gifts for the newborn, these gatherings are focused on nurturing the mother-to-be and wishing her love and luck. Controversially, they are said to derive from the Navajo tradition of “blessingway” – and have been condemned as cultural appropriation. Less controversially, they involve henna and are perfect for displaying on Instagram. “It is about honouring the mother’s journey and gathering a group of female friends who are offering their support instead of giving gifts,” said Sue Boughton, a doula, or birth coach, from London, who thinks mother blessings are becoming increasingly popular as people look for an alternative to commercialised baby showers. “Many new mothers feel isolated, and this is about promising to give them time and energy.” At Danni Ferreira’s mother blessing, five friends wrapped cords round their wrists in a circle, tied string around a candle and made cards with affirmations on them. “One that stood out to me was to trust my body,” said the 35-year-old from Wakefield. “It felt empowering. It was more of a celebration than a baby shower. Getting together and supporting each other feels like a feminist thing to do. It was a good build-up to the birth.” Connie Tu is one of a growing number of henna artists who can be hired to decorate the pregnant woman’s belly at these events. She says the format varies: “I have seen the expectant mother receiving a ‘food train’ – a list of friends who take turns to deliver food to the house after the baby arrives – and ones that are a simple gathering of close friends,” she said. Fran Green, 37, from London, has been to three mother blessings in the past year. At the most recent, the friends sat round in a circle and shared food. At the beginning of the ceremony, everyone introduced themselves by giving their mother’s and grandmothers’ names and wished their friend a calm and peaceful birth. Then they read a poem and painted her arms. “We were going to massage her feet in oil but she didn’t want that,” said Green. “She said she’d got a rash.” One explanation for the trend is that families want to acknowledge life transitions such as births, marriages and deaths, but with a personal twist. “From wedding vows that couples write for each other to eco-funerals, it’s about stepping away from religion, but still signifying certain values to others, such as, ‘we are eco, we are spiritual and we are original’,” said Charlotte Faircloth, a sociology lecturer at University College London. Social media platforms have also helped to spread the word. With flower crowns, painted bumps and floaty dresses, the ceremonies photograph well: there are tens of thousands of pictures posted under #motherblessing on Instagram. Some even hire professional photographers to document the occasion. Despite the avowed intentions of some young mothers to eschew commercialised baby showers, experts say that businesses are cashing in on the new trend. Doulas charge around £250 to perform the ceremonies and some involve costly flower displays and other expensive decorations. But Caroline Gatrell of Liverpool University Management School says high expenditure is not necessary. “Some remain simple in form, with attendees contributing food and, where possible, flowers from their gardens. The point of the blessing is a chance for close friends and family to shower the mum with good wishes. It does not need a doula to organise this,” she said. Jen Harvie, professor of contemporary theatre and performance at Queen Mary University of London, thinks participants need to be careful when replicating traditionally spiritual ceremonies. “There is a lack of understanding, and it is cultural appropriation,” she said. “On the one hand, there is this fantasy of decommercialising the baby shower but, on the other, [Navajo culture] is being commercialised in a different way.” Her advice is to imagine your own ceremony, based on your own values. “Use things from your own cultural background,” she said. “Just think about that.”"

I wasn’t being judgmental about it, but Nigel – a friendly, chatty dad, but the type you could imagine attending a taping of Top Gear – knew I wrote a column for the Observer and probably presumed I’d come straight to the pub from a dolphin séance. His anti-PC alarms all started ringing. ‘Surnames,’ I said to Nigel. ‘If I said to you: “Just last week, Doherty and McLaughlin went to the funfair,” you’d imagine two blokes, wouldn’t you?’ ‘Not sure.’ ‘You would – because unless otherwise indicated, surnames denote men, even though last time I checked all women have a surname. And it’s not like going to the funfair is gendered. Even if you change it to “Doherty and McLaughlin went for mojitos,” I still think of two blokes. Because we’re the default, Nigel. You have to add a qualifier for a woman to even be connected to the surname she lives her whole life with.’ ‘You’ve thought about this a lot.’ ‘Well, yeah, because, putting aside the rights and wrongs, I’m just confused. I mean, what are the rules? With toddler clothes, I kinda get fairies and princesses being for girls because fairies and princesses are girls. But why are so many neutral things for boys? I mean, all sexes drive cars, and they’re a boy thing, too. More men throughout history have caught butterflies and studied flowers than women, so why are those girly? Is it because they’re colourful? Then why are rainbows unisex? Why are dogs and cats unisex, while dinosaurs, big or small, carnivores or herbivores, always coded as boyish? I just don’t get it.’ Nigel sipped his drink then said, ‘What about Cher and Madonna?’ ‘Excuse me?’ ‘You said all women have surnames. What about Cher and Madonna?’ He had me there. Since it’s best to quit while you’re ahead in the offline world, we shook on the fact that gendered clothing was weird, and some women don’t have surnames. Just then our mutual friend returned to ask why I’d been ranting at Nigel for five minutes. ‘Well, you know,’ I said, as if it was obvious. ‘Twitter was down.’ Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 09.44 BST Phew. I thought the opening episode set a cracking pace, but everything was ratcheted up a notch further tonight as a dangerous new player entered the mix, trailing bloody retribution and clouds of brimstone in his wake (alas poor Bonnie Gold, that was no way for a brave “fighter boy” to die). Nor was the brutal Jimmy McCavern’s arrival the only problem facing the Shelby family, with hints of betrayal everywhere and pressures mounting both in parliament and Birmingham. No wonder an increasingly paranoid Tommy is beginning to resemble a 1920s version of Shakespeare’s Richard III. A winter of discontent is almost certainly coming. If the king falls, who and how many will he take with him? As the old quote has it: “Just because you’re paranoid, doesn’t mean they’re not after you.” Certainly Tommy, swigging morphine in his very big house in the country, is not exactly at his most stable but it’s also true that he has good reason to feel besieged. At work, the saturnine Oswald Mosley clearly hopes to use him for his own gain, at home, the Billy Boys, led by the fearsome McCavern (Brian Gleeson), have designs on the racetrack business. Worst of all, there’s clearly more than one traitor in the family, given that Aberama Gold’s campsite location, which Michael couldn’t have known, was betrayed. (It is one of the few absolute truths on this show that Johnny Dogs is no traitor). So what of Michael? Long-time readers of this blog will know that I’ve never been convinced by the Shelby princeling. He’s always carried the whiff of unbridled ambition around his shoulders and that’s only got stronger since the move to New York. Is he being set up by the IRA or has he had contact with the Billy Boys? It’s a measure of the ambivalence of Finn Cole’s performance that I’m genuinely unsure. He could have his eyes on the main prize but he could equally easily be exactly as he seems – a hot-headed fool of a boy and out of his depth. I’m more interested in new wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) who is clearly a lot sharper than she’s letting on. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she turns out to be very dangerous indeed. (I also wouldn’t be surprised if she ends up training her sights on Tommy.) Finally, what about Lizzie? It was interesting to learn that the house and the legitimate business is in the second Mrs Shelby’s name and nice to be reminded that in the right mood she takes few prisoners. I’ve always felt that the Shelby clan, and the men in particular, have a tendency to underestimate Lizzie, and tonight’s episode underlined that. In fact, I rather think that Tommy’s great tragedy might be that she’s actually a good match for him, but he’s only going to realise it when it’s far, far too late. This is clearly going to be a series in which the Shelbys are under siege and the introduction of McCavern added a whole new dimension to the battle in hand. Fans of Irish crime thriller Love/Hate will know that Gleeson is quite brilliant at being unhinged and the brief moments we saw of chief Billy Boy Jimmy suggested that he’s going to have a fine old time bringing vengeance to Small Heath. That said I have my doubts about his understanding of game theory given that the brutal death of Bonnie Gold is only going to send Aberama on the sort of revenge mission that wouldn’t be out of place in a Sam Peckinpah movie. If Jimmy kills first and deals with the consequences later, Mosley is an altogether more slippery beast. I enjoyed the conversation between him, Tommy and Ada, not least because Sam Claflin is clearly having so much fun with the role. We also learned that Mosley has made some sort of contact with whom I would presume are the UVF, given the later suggestion that the Billy Boys provide security at his rallies, although it was kept just ambiguous enough to suggest that the MP might be trying to play both sides. That said, I suspect that the “Irish question” is just so much obfuscation on Mosley’s part – his real interest lies in both Tommy’s populism and his brutality, which he hopes to harness to his own ends. From the bleak, western-style opening to the final scene paying homage to the great gangster films of the past, this episode was beautifully directed. All credit to Anthony Byrne. In an episode filled with brutal moments, the most devastating was one of the quietest as Tommy callously told Lizzie: “You know in my head I still pay you for it.” The Billy Boys were a real-life gang – their song is still sung at Glasgow Rangers games to this day – and Gleeson’s fictional character is clearly based on their leader, Billy Fullerton, who did indeed provide security for Mosley’s fascist rallies. Those interested in learning more should check out Andrew Davies’s fascinating book, City of Gangs. Did Polly believe Michael? I wasn’t sure if she genuinely thought he was telling the truth or simply protected her only surviving child. Alas poor Arthur. He’s going to be taking solace in a lot of Al Jolson records now that the newly sober Linda has clearly left. Finn’s attempts to prove himself a Shelby “General” continue to amuse me. I also like the fact that that clan are moving into fixing football as well as the horses. Hello to Emmett J Scanlan, of Hollyoaks and The Fall fame, who popped up as the under-pressure Billy Grade. Hurrah. Confirmation that Karl is both alive and also good at chess (I secretly think that one day Karl will inherit the world – as Ada’s child he’s bound to be the smartest of the new generation). Full marks for the use of Nadine Shah’s haunting Evil, a song about the corrosiveness nature of hate, ahead of Tommy’s meeting with Mosley. “May Carleton spoke about you the way I imagine one might about a party they barely remembered, where you crash the car into the dovecote and live on champagne and cocaine for three whole days – you know that kind of party?” He’s a terrible human being but Mosley appreciates a good bash. So what did you think? Can Tommy possibly escape all his enemies? Who is the traitor in the Shelby camp? Or is there more than one? And where do you stand on the great Irish v Scottish whisk(e)y debate?

The Andromeda galaxy is a collection of a trillion stars lying 2.5m light years distant. Also known as M31, it is the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way. Once you have located this admittedly faint object, you can marvel at the fact that the light entering your eye set out on its journey 2.5m years ago – before modern humans evolved. To begin your quest, find the four stars that make up the body of Pegasus. Then hop along two stars of Andromeda to Mirach. Turn through 90° and hop along two fainter stars. Then concentrate. Once your eyes have adjusted to the dark, which could take about 40 minutes, you should see a faint fuzzy patch of light just above the second of these fainter stars. That’s the Andromeda galaxy. The chart shows the view this week looking almost overhead in the eastern sky."

Last modified on Mon 5 Aug 2019 16.33 BST After the disappointment and disarray of Hockenheim, Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes enjoyed a remarkable, redemptive comeback at the Hungarian Grand Prix. This time – in the natural amphitheatre of the Hungaroring – sunshine, driver and team all burned brightly, with the latter’s stagecraft magnificent to behold as Hamilton beat Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to first place. The race was gripping, tense and almost impossible to call until the final laps and even Hamilton had doubted whether he could pull it off but when the world champion and Mercedes are this good they are irrepressible. This was yet another masterclass from the British driver and his team. Mercedes had taken a gamble but in doing so called the race to perfection, returning one of the best victories this season – no small praise given they have won 10 of the 12 grands prix. The race had hung in the balance but although Verstappen had led almost throughout, Hamilton, on fresher tyres, swept past the 21-year-old Dutchman with three laps to go to take the flag. Mercedes’ decision to pit their driver a second time gave Hamilton a decisive advantage he exploited brilliantly. Knowing that overtaking is tricky through the twisting corners of the circuit, he believed his team would have to play a strong strategic game to ensure he could gain places and they proved more than up to the task. The team and drivers had been through an extensive debrief after performing poorly in the German Prix at Hockenheim a week earlier and duly came back with a display of precision execution, with Hamilton at the sharp end, delivering with a clinical drive. “I don’t really make a lot of mistakes, the last one [in Germany] was a massive off-weekend for me,” he said. “These two weeks the team have been really great and supportive in allowing me to recover and giving me the best support group possible.” Hamilton also acknowledged what a team effort it had been. “The guys are very calm when they talk about the strategy like the one today. ‘No, no, I truly believed you could do it,’ they told me. But I am sure they were nervous as hell that it wasn’t going to work. But collectively we made it happen.” Hamilton’s 81st career win is also his seventh at the Hungarian GP and he has eight wins from 12 races, his best start to a season. His position looks almost unassailable, leading his teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points. Verstappen is a further seven points back in third and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who was third here, trails the Dutchman by 25 points. The race unfolded in an almost classical three-act structure into which the protagonists threw so much effort that even Verstappen emerged smiling after his suitably theatrical engagement with Hamilton. “I think Lewis was on fire,” he said. Verstappen held the lead from pole and with Hamilton immediately up to second from third at the expense of Bottas, they were nose to tail until the first stops, a teasing, tense scene-setter. Red Bull pitted their man first, on lap 25, with Mercedes following six laps later. Hamilton immediately attacked. He flew after Verstappen, taking almost two and a half seconds out of his lead in two laps. He had caught him by lap 34 and his pace was superb. He climbed all over the back of Verstappen, who defended stoutly. With Hamilton harrying, on lap 39 they went wheel to wheel through turns one to four, in a thrilling battle. Hamilton went wide in a brave bid to pass on the outside of turn four as Verstappen held his place. This was clean, gripping racing but not enough for Hamilton to win so Mercedes rolled the dice in the final third. They pulled him in unexpectedly for a second stop to take the medium tyre on lap 48. It was a bold move. Red Bull could not respond to pit Verstappen without losing the lead so he had to stay out while Hamilton set off to make up the 20 seconds he needed to catch him. Hamilton had the fresher rubber but Verstappen track position, either might yet have won it. However once in clean air, he pumped out fastest laps and, with Verstappen’s tyres gone, had caught up by lap 66 of 70. Verstappen had given his all but was powerless while Hamilton, relentless, was not to be denied. He swept past round the outside of turn one a lap later to take the lead and the win. “I was really proud of how I delegated my work throughout and collectively with the team we did an exceptional job,” Hamilton said. “This morning they said a two-stop would not happen and when they called for it I wondered if it would work. “A gamble is always a good thing. It felt like a big gamble. It was collectively a bold, risky strategy call, then it was doing the job at the end of the day. I had to do those laps to chew out the gap he had on me.” Ecstasy and relief seemed to vie for dominance as Hamilton climbed from his car; both had turned to exultation by the time he reached the podium with an ear-to-ear grin. As he goes into F1’s summer break he and Mercedes delivered the perfect adieu. Only seven days after their season low, Hamilton and his team are soaring once more. Charles Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari. Carlos Sainz took an excellent fifth, his second in a row for McLaren, in front of the second Red Bull of Pierre Gasly. Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Räikkönen was seventh. Bottas was eighth with Lando Norris ninth for McLaren in front of the Toro Rosso of Alexander Albon."

Last modified on Tue 20 Aug 2019 11.51 BST Bringing your work home with you takes on a whole new meaning in Dominic Cooper’s Victorian terraced property in north London. One bedroom is furnished entirely with pieces from the New York hotel room set seen in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in which he reprises his character Sky. “I really needed to do the room up quickly and so I bought all of the furniture from that set after the film was finished. I call it the Mamma Mia! floor.” Occupying the second and third floors of a three-storey terrace, the property comprised a two-bedroom flat on the third floor and a one-bedroom on the second floor when Cooper bought it. Seeing the potential to extend into the eves of the roof, he enlisted E2 architects to create an upper floor open-plan loft-style kitchen-living space, adding reclaimed rustic timber joists in the ceiling and an exposed brick wall to contrast with the grey brick tiles in the sleek, modern white kitchen. A skylight punctuates the wood joists, flooding the room with natural light. “I’ve been slowly working my way down the building,” says Cooper, “buying different bits of it and turning it into a home.” The actor first stumbled across the property when he and his former flatmate James Corden were looking for places to buy. “The area had the same feel to it as Blackheath where I grew up, and I loved its proximity to Soho,” he says. “It’s so important to have a cosy nest to come back to, in among the chaos and madness of having a job where I travel so much. One of my favourite things now is to walk through Regent’s Park and get into the heart of the city. It’s a really nice, mind-clearing journey through greenery into the hustle and bustle.” A place to relax, the flat has also been a party pad in its time. “I actually have a letter framed on my wall from my next-door neighbour when she was much younger, which says, ‘Please, Mr Cooper, I have my Spelling B competition tomorrow morning and it’s now 5am and you’re still playing drum and bass.’” The home mixes modern design pieces, collected vintage furniture and an unusual number of lamps. “I have a kind of light fetish,” he admits. In the upper living area a record player from New Orleans sits on an old teak Danish sideboard and piles of photography books hold up a rickety glass coffee table that once belonged to a friend’s father, a scenic artist at the Royal Opera House. “He lived on a houseboat in Chelsea and that table reminds me of so many great times we had on the boat, like wonderful New Year’s Eve parties.” A rather sturdier dining table from Roche Bobois takes centre stage in the kitchen, with a set of Eames 1958 aluminium chairs. The sculptures remind me of my grandmother. I used to watch her at work and she was always covered in clay Prints of the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers album cover and Kraftwerk’s 1975 Radio-Activity hang on the walls, the latter a gift from a friend for the opening night of the play Phèdre at the National Theatre, in which Dominic starred as Hippolytus opposite Helen Mirren. Downstairs, a figurative sculpture by his grandmother hides in a wall nook, and her sculpture of a ballerina swirling around in a snow globe is perched on the glass shelves in the guest room ensuite. “She sculpted the dancers along with other pieces,” he says. “I used to watch her make them in her conservatory when we lived in Blackheath, and remember her always being covered in clay, so I love having them around the place to remind me of her.” Her Ukiyo-e Japanese art prints, which she bought in the 80s at Liberty, now hang above an antique chest of drawers in one lilac-hued bedroom offset by a brown fabric feature wall that faces a painting of a female nude, another gift, this time from the artist Jonathan Yeo. A cherry maroon wall in an office-turned-guest bedroom provides a bold backdrop for a 60s fold-down bureau and shelves filled with artefacts, vintage cameras and, jokes Cooper, “all my OCD colour-coordinated books.” A bright red padded leather chair – one of two he acquired 15 years ago from the office of theatrical agent Pippa Markham, credited with helping Ian Dury’s acting career – sits under a midcentury glass and wood desk, yet another recycling gem from the set of Mamma Mia! At every turn there are smart colour touches and textures, such as the dark inky green palette in the ensuite bathroom that works a metal and glass industrial aesthetic. A bronze sculpture by his mother blends into the coppery tiled shower walls. “I chose those tiles because they reminded me of the stage in Waiting for Godot, a play I did years ago at drama school. We built this huge cube of rust,” he explains. “When I saw that tile it was exactly the same colour, and I thought it would look great.” There was never a grand interiors masterplan for Cooper’s home, but he likes how it’s worked out. “It’s been a progressive process. I’ve got to know the place and have added things along the way. I’ve loved buying little bits of furniture here and there over the years, and I think the more you do that and accumulate other things from different places, you add parts of your life into the building. It makes for a much more personal space, where each little corner has something to do with someone or somewhere you remember.”"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 19.00 BST A coalition of climate campaigners and business groups have called for a ban on all petrol and diesel vehicles in Scottish cities as part of a multibillion-pound strategy to cut carbon emissions. The climate emergency response group, a coalition of 19 environment groups, civic institutions, companies and business groups, said the Scottish government had to significantly speed up and strengthen its responses to the threats posed by global heating. That includes focusing the £11bn spent by the Scottish government every year on buying goods and services that reduce carbon emissions. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has agreed 2045 will be Scotland’s new net-zero target for  CO2 emissions, with ministers due to set out more detailed proposals in coming weeks. Claire Mack, the chief executive of Scottish Renewables, an industry body for energy companies, said: “We are already witnessing the effects of climate change, and now is the moment when we must accelerate our response if we are to avoid the worst effects and secure the many social and economic benefits of moving to a climate neutral economy.” The group, which includes the University of Edinburgh, the Energy Saving Trust and the landowners’ body Scottish Land and Estates, has produced a 12-point plan that recommends: • A ban on petrol and diesel-powered cars in all city centres by 2030 • Establishing four green, low-carbon city investment deals • A £100m fund to decarbonise farming • Regional land use plans to maximise the countryside’s role in cutting CO2 emissions • A public information campaign to promote climate-friendly, lower meat and dairy diets The UK government expects to be chosen as a co-host of next year’s COP26 global climate talks. It has recommended Glasgow hosts the summit later in the year, adding to pressure on both the Scottish and UK governments to intensify their efforts on the climate crisis. The Scottish government is spending tens of millions of pounds on various road and rail electrification projects, and on energy efficiency, but has yet to deliver any cuts in CO2 emissions from transport or farming, while bus use is falling. Its ministers have refused to support calls from the Scottish Green party for urban speed limits to be cut to 20mph across Scotland, claiming it was not electorally popular. Sturgeon has, however, abandoned plans to cut aviation taxes and her government’s support for wind power has resulted in Scotland becoming a net exporter of zero carbon electricity. The climate emergency response group also includes companies and organisations with a business interest in promoting low-carbon energy, such as the forestry industry body Confor, and Star Renewable Energy, which makes heat pumps."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/25/billy-vunipola-england-eddie-jones-twickenham-rugby-world-cup-ireland,"Gerard Meagher at Twickenham Sun 25 Aug 2019 22.00 BST Billy Vunipola has warned that England must learn how to produce their Twickenham form away from home to be considered genuine World Cup contenders in Japan. England’s record-breaking victory over Ireland on Saturday has sent expectations soaring just a few weeks before the World Cup starts but Vunipola says there is “massive scope” to improve on the road. Eddie Jones immediately sought to temper expectations after his side’s eight-try victory, instructing his players to “avoid the noise” and he will aim to keep their feet on the ground by putting them through a gruelling “pre-season” in Treviso when, on Wednesday, England return to Italy for another warm-weather training camp. England have won 22 of their 24 Tests at Twickenham under Jones and in their last two home matches they have scored a combined 90 points in big wins against Wales and Ireland. However, since beating Italy in Rome at the start of the 2018 Six Nations England have lost six of their eight away matches. “I would like to see that performance away from home,” Vunipola said. “That is the biggest thing for me. I have said it to Eddie in the changing rooms. It is something we need to start doing away from Twickenham. That is the biggest challenge next, going to Japan and doing it away from all our fans and the comforts of our home changing room. There is massive scope for us to improve. That is the biggest challenge for us. Now everyone is going to pump up our tyres because we did well this week, but it was only last week [after losing to Wales] that everyone was hammering us.” Jones was at least boosted by the fact that the 24-hour citing window passed on Sunday without any reprimands for his players. George Kruis received a yellow card in the final minute for a high tackle on Jack Carty and was fortunate to escape a red – the referee, Nigel Owens, choosing not to review the incident and determining that, according to World Rugby’s decision-making framework for high tackles, the threshold for a sending off was not met. The citing commissioner also opted against any further action. Jones recently launched into an unprovoked rant at World Rugby over refereeing inconsistencies after New Zealand’s Scott Barrett was shown a red card in the All Blacks’ heavy defeat by Australia. The Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, has expressed similar concerns. Jones added: “The high tackle is something that common sense has to be applied [to], otherwise we’re going to have a World Cup where it’s basically a lottery of how many players you have on the field.”"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 15.02 BST Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Here’s an intriguing question from UndercoverOps, who has been re-reading “my favourite book from childhood”, The Hounds of the Morrigan by Pat O’Shea: It’s not a book I’ve heard much about since, did it never make it on to the classics list? I have been very much enjoying its humour and magic again as an adult decades later. It seems to have all the key elements of a children’s adventure - magic, peril, a quest, no parents. It even starts in a secondhand bookshop! A more grown-up form of innocence for Malinkibear, who has been reading Edith Wharton: Finished The Age of Innocence yesterday. I picked it up on a whim, as a book I’d heard of but knew nothing about, and it fit into my “read more books not written by straight cis white men” resolution. (Somewhat) surprisingly enjoyed it, I felt it was a nuanced critique on high society and the inequality in permissiveness between the sexes - an inequality that remains today. Kevin Barry’s Booker longlisted Night Boat To Tangier has impressed allworthy: Hell, he can he write. Wonderful descriptions of place and he can capture a character in a few breathtaking brushstrokes. I’m still not sure about its form which he seems to wrestle with at times. That could be me but well worth reading. Alexia_R has finished Paula Chiziane’s The First Wife, translated from the Portuguese by David Brookshaw: Apparently the first book by a Mozambican woman to be translated into English. Parts of this are bitingly funny, other parts terribly sad. The story meanders around a bit and is pretty long but it reads so smoothly, I didn’t mind, and I learnt something about the north/south divide in Mozambique and some regional cultural/sexual practices that were completely new to me … I’m going to be thinking about it for a while to come, I think. WebberExpat says that Zola’s Germinal is rightly “reputed as a masterpiece”: It’s a book that feels urgent, like Urban Sinclair’s The Jungle and Steinbeck’s The Grapes Of Wrath, Germinal seems to be a book that is screaming at us today. It has a lot to say about what happens when the many have the fewest resources and when revolution fails to bring the promised cornucopiae, the people will swing blindly and viciously. If you have no hope of every climbing out of the coal heap and warming your hands and filling your stomach, losing your life seems paltry and preordained. It also has a lot to say about how easy it is for the well-meaning idiot to cobble together a philosophy to harness that rage (and let’s not get onto the fucking nefarious idiots that we’re staring down today). The Makioka Sisters by Jun’ichirō Tanizaki has kept LeoToadstool busy: Considered one of the greatest Japanese novels of the 20th century, it’s a family epic centred on the lives of four sisters of an upper-middle class family in late-1930s Osaka. It has a bit of a Russian feel to it, reminiscent not of Anna Karenina (slyly referenced in the text) but of Chekhov, in its chronicling of the experiences and little dramas of family life: illnesses, excursions to shrines, visits to Tokyo, marriage proposals, migrations, etc. Not the most action-packed book ever written, but still worth persisting with. Edward Seidensticker’s translation, dating from 1957, reads decently, if a little flat, and is often hilarious in its datedness (he devotes a footnote to explaining what “sushi” is, for instance). FatFreddyCat has also been reading about Japan, in Another Kyoto by Alex Kerr: Kerr has spent several decades in this remarkable city and the book originated in aimless wanderings around Kyoto with a friend during which they would discursively and at length talk around various things that caught their eye as they went. It suffers slightly from the pretentious over-solemnity that Americans in particular can bring to living in Japan, but that small criticism aside, it’s a fascinating book. Finally, The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton has provided a wealth of useful material for Elias_Artifex: Ostensibly a study into the causes and treatment of melancholy (corresponding very roughly to what we would call depression) it is a actually a pretty free-ranging review of theoretical understand (cosmological, physiological and psychological) as it stood when the book was written (1621). Dr Johnson said that it was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise. I keep a copy of The Anatomy by my bed and often read a few pages to calm the mind - something about the writing has this effect. One bit that never fails to lift my spirits is the section on laxatives (very comprehensive), the application of which arises from the Galenic/Hippocratic notion that melancholy (an excess of black bile) can be relieved by purging. The idea that depression can be lifted simply by a good clear-out is very appealing somehow. Not even somehow. Téa Obreht’s second novel is out after eight years. What took so long? Why Beatrix Potter initially self-published Peter Rabbit. Book riot recommend 10 books in translation by female authors. Insects apparently have literary buzz.

What if, for example, part of the explanation for the “populist wave” of the last few years – Trump, Brexit, the rise of the European far right – is that voters watched too much crappy TV, and it rotted their brains? It feels obnoxious even to contemplate the thought, given how perfectly it plays into metropolitan prejudice about the other side being stupid. But a rigorous, data-rich new study makes it harder to dismiss the idea on grounds of queasiness alone. Researchers studied the growth of the Italian broadcaster Mediaset, and found that those heavily exposed as children to its pabulum of cartoons, soap operas and quiz shows were almost 10% more likely to support populists, because poorer cognitive skills left them more susceptible to politicians peddling simplistic arguments. The paper, published in the American Economic Review, is fascinating partly because of the theories it rejects. Perhaps you’re assuming that because Mediaset is Silvio Berlusconi’s outfit – his son is now the chief executive – he must have used it for rightwing propaganda. But the network featured little news coverage during the period in question, and anyway the “Mediaset effect” proved equally beneficial to his rival Beppe Grillo’s leftish Five Star Movement: it was populism, not Berlusconi-ism, that got the boost. Or maybe you think the same kind of people were liable to watch Mediaset and vote populist, without one causing the other? But the gradual geographic spread of the channel’s reach, over the course of the 1980s, created a “natural experiment” that virtually rules that out. Kids in towns where it was harder to pick up the Mediaset signal, thanks purely to aspects of Italian geography, were less affected than their peers. The result was that heavy Mediaset consumers ended up with poorer cognitive skills, and less of an orientation to civic life, as well as performing worse on maths and literacy tests. Still, it’s crucial to grasp that this sort of “dumbing down” doesn’t happen because bad TV somehow injects stupidity into people’s heads. It’s about the opportunity cost: every hour you’re sitting in front of a rubbish cartoon is an hour you’re not reading, exploring the physical world, or watching educational programming. The same is true of video games, social media and so on. They don’t have to be bad to be bad; they just have to get in the way of your doing something better. There are echoes here of the work of Neil Postman, the media theorist who argued that Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, as opposed to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, correctly foretold our future: it was our addiction to mindless pleasure that would doom us, not state coercion. Then again, this new study shows it’s not an either/or choice, since apparently mindless pleasure helps make you the kind of person who favours authoritarian leaders. It’s also a reminder that we shouldn’t dismiss explanations for social and political events just because they sound snobby. The fact that a theory reinforces your existing views doesn’t make it right; but it doesn’t make it wrong, either. Neil Postman’s most famous book, Amusing Ourselves To Death (1985), is unsettlingly prescient on the modern attention economy, which, far from keeping us informed, “leads [us] away from knowing”"

https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/25/celebrate-the-season-wih-these-two-great-tomato-recipes-from-nigel-slater,"Celebrate the season with these two glorious dishes – a spicy sauce with ginger and coconut, and a tart with ricotta Nigel Slater Sun 25 Aug 2019 05.59 BST There has been a subtle change of step. Spiky dahlias in carnival colours have replaced the pink roses in the jam jar on the kitchen table and the broad beans have made way for climbing beans as thin and crisp as pencils. But it is the tomato that has been at the heart of this week’s cooking. Golden fruits barely larger than sweets; pointy, tough-skinned plum tomatoes and round, green-shouldered fruit of dazzling acidity. Plum tomatoes are cooking fruit, their depth of flavour only apparent when they meet the heat of the oven or hob The plum tomatoes were the first to catch my eye. A cooking fruit, their depth of flavour only becomes apparent when they meet the heat of the oven or hob, their thick walls keeping their shape better than any other variety when baked. The generosity of seeds and pulp, when removed with a teaspoon, leaves ample room for a stuffing of rice and mint or fat balls of couscous with soft spices, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. I made a sauce for the tomatoes with mustard seeds and garlic, turmeric and chillies. The heat of the spices, softened by coconut cream, produced a sauce the colour of terracotta. The fruit was both filled and surrounded with the spiced coconut sauce, giving the impression of something that had been cooked lovingly, for hours. In fact, it took little more than an hour from start to finish. This is a dish that benefits from being eaten warm rather than hot. When I picked up the plum tomatoes I couldn’t help putting a punnet of cherry toms in my bag as well. Tight-skinned and turmeric-hued, many were eaten as I unpacked the shopping, but I saved enough to cover a ricotta tart. There is a generous amount of sauce here that I like to ladle into the baking dish, then spoon it over the tomatoes at the table. We soaked up the spice-flecked sauce with flatbread warmed in the oven while the tomatoes were resting. Serves 4 onions 2, medium groundnut oil 2 tbspmustard seeds 1 tspgarlic 3 clovesginger 3cm piecechilli 1, red and medium hot red or orange peppers 2 cherry tomatoes 20ground turmeric 1 tsp plum tomatoes 8, largecoconut cream 160mlmint leaves 12 Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm the groundnut oil in a deep saucepan over moderate heat then add the mustard seeds and let them cook for a minute or two, without letting them colour. Stir in the onions, letting them soften and giving them the occasional stir, while you peel and slice the garlic, peel and finely shred the ginger and finely chop the chilli. Stir the garlic, ginger and chilli into the onions and continue cooking until the onions are honey coloured and translucent. Core and thinly slice the peppers and stir in. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Cook over a moderate heat, with the occasional stir, until the pepper starts to soften, then stir in the ground turmeric and the cherry tomatoes. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove a slice from one side of each of the plum tomatoes (or the top if you are using large vine tomatoes), then scoop out the seeds and core from each tomato to give a deep hollow. Place the tomatoes in a baking dish. Finely chop the filling you have removed, discarding any tough cores as you go, and stir into the onions. When the mixture has cooked down to a soft, brightly coloured mush, stir in the coconut cream, bring to the boil, season with salt, then remove from the heat. Fill the hollowed-out tomatoes with the sauce, spooning any extra around them in the dish. Bake for 40 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and fragrant. Scatter with mint leaves and serve. The lightness of ricotta, the soft texture and gentle flavour, sets it apart from other cheeses. Introduce a beaten egg, pepper and a little grated parmesan and you have a filling for rolled pancakes, a light cheese custard for pastry tarts or a delicate pudding. Serves 6 puff pastry 325gricotta 400ggarlic 1 large cloveparmesan 50g basil leaves 50gparsley leaves 20geggs 2, lightly beatencream 150mlplain flour 2 heaped tbspcherry tomatoes 400g You will also need a rectangular baking tin (a swiss roll tin) measuring 20cm x 30cm. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 and place a baking sheet in the oven. This will help the pastry to bake crisply. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured board and line the base and sides of a shallow, rectangular baking sheet, 20cm by 30cm. Put the ricotta in a bowl, season with freshly ground black pepper. Peel the garlic, then add a large pinch of salt and pound to a paste using a pestle and mortar, then add to the ricotta. Finely grate the parmesan. Remove the basil leaves from their stems, finely chop them with the parsley and add, together with the parmesan, to the ricotta. Stir in the 2 lightly beaten eggs, then the cream and flour. Spread the ricotta mixture over the pastry in the baking tin and smooth the surface. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, then arrange them, cut side up, on top of the tart. Place the tart on top of the heated baking sheet and bake for 40-45 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the tart has puffed up. It may seem a little soft in the middle. Leave the tart to settle for 20 minutes before slicing. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater"
https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/16/timmy-creed-spliced-edinburgh-festival-hurling,"Timmy Creed quit the tough Irish sport damaged and disillusioned. But he returned to his club ‘undercover’ – to turn its toxic masculinity into a play Fri 16 Aug 2019 10.13 BST


Last modified on Mon 19 Aug 2019 09.47 BST ‘You can hit people,” says Timmy Creed, reassuringly, as he swings his hurling stick inches from my head. “As long as you’re going for the ball, you can do what you want.” Creed is teaching me how to use a “hurley” properly. Not because I’m considering a switch into the world of gaelic sports (my inability to hold the stick correctly put paid to that idea, along with the fact that I’m a total wimp who hates getting hurt) but because he’s promoting his new play, Spliced. It’s about hurling, the Irish sport Creed spent much of his teens and 20s playing to an impressively high club level. But it’s also about more than that – masculinity, peer pressure, body image, conformity, feminism and self-discovery. Creed thinks it will help the interview if we knock a hurling ball around to get a feel for the game. (The play is normally staged outdoors, in one of Ireland’s numerous handball alleys, although for its run in Edinburgh a squash court will suffice.) Mercifully, he plays gentle with me as he explains his love-hate relationship with the sport that moulded him. “It gave me an identity,” he says. “But that identity shapes the way you are with men, with women, with how you see the world. A whole other side to you gets missed.” Creed was a shy, skinny boy growing up – and not very good at hurling. But the sport helped him connect with other boys so he stuck at it, practising alone until he’d gained the respect of his manager and teammates. His club, Bishopstown in Cork, became highly successful for their age group, winning the county championship every year, turning the players into local celebrities. “You get a swagger,” says Creed. “You are the chosen ones of the area and you can behave how you want. In school, we were given special treatment because we were the stars. You could see how other guys were like, ‘Why does he not have to do his homework?’” Yet success came with huge pressure to remain committed. Weekends away from training, or even just an interest in other pastimes, was deemed to be letting the team down. He couldn’t even turn up for training on his skateboard. The camaraderie had an unpleasant side, too. Was his own behaviour regrettable? “Yeah,” he says, pausing to reflect. “The way I used to pursue women, or the way I thought was the way to do it. It was never anything too offensive, but it was never about finding an emotional connection, which is what I strive for most now.” While playing, Creed started to realise that the male behaviour we often hear about as “toxic” was a mindset drilled into boys across Ireland from a terrifyingly young age. “We were being educated, within this group, that this was how you behaved. Nobody taught us otherwise. So if someone is talking about a woman in a derogatory way and you’re the person who calls them out, it would have been, ‘Who are you of a sudden, undermining the way we’ve been?’ The behaviour comes from a conditioning that the boy won’t even be aware of. It takes a lot of time to unpack that and say, ‘What was I doing at this age?’” It’s behaviour he doesn’t shy away from in the play, and the honesty can be bracing. As one line about the macho mindset goes: “Get her home, get her showered, get her fingered, get her bucked. Send her packing. Walk of shame. Fuck the name. Tell the tale. Make em laugh. Have the craic. GO ON THE LADS!!” I was bricking myself when we performed it at the club – but some of the guys came up to me with tears in their eyes Creed struggled mentally after quitting the sport, and says he had to piece himself back together. The way forward came via a lucky break – he put himself up for a role in the Irish film My Brothers and ended up getting the lead. “They wanted an ‘introspective, troubled-looking newcomer’,” he says, laughing at the perfection of the fit. The experience showed him another life was possible and, when the time came to write his own play, he knew what it had to be about. Spliced – named after the metal band that holds a hurley together – tells his own story, with the first half dedicated to the thrill of the sport, and the second his disillusionment, self-discovery and redemption. To write it, Creed went method, re-enrolling at his old hurling team after a seven-year hiatus. “I felt like I was a spy infiltrating the IRA,” he says. “I was seeing the culture that moulded me from a new perspective.” BoutSummerhall, 10.20am, until 25 August.

Read the review His return aroused many negative feelings: on his first night of training, the coach sized up his puny calf muscles and prescribed a weights and protein programme. But more complicated was the fact that he found himself falling in love with the game again. “It’s so beautiful to play,” he says. “There’s this deep connection to the ground and ancient Ireland.” Creed found himself slowly being sucked back into his previous way of life. “I remember thinking, ‘Jesus, you do all this work on yourself to unpack these things – but you can just as easily slip back into them.’” Then he broke his hand and was forced to retire for good. It’s Creed’s insider position, and genuine love of the sport, that gives him a credibility when discussing how we can tackle some of masculinity’s less appealing aspects. “A lot of people say to me you have to call out toxic masculinity. But ‘toxic’ is such a strong word. People hear it and their initial response is ‘That’s not me’ or ‘I don’t even want the conversation if you’re calling me that.’ It excludes men from this big conversation of openness and respect for women. Can’t we bring them in to share their experience?” One of the most important moments in Creed’s life came when he took the play to the club to perform it in front of the players. “I was bricking myself,” he says, “because I was using some of the material I’d got from going back.” But the reaction astounded him. “Some of the guys – big, strong-on-the-outside players who dedicated their lives to this sport – came up to me with tears in their eyes, saying thank you so much for articulating something we all struggle with but have never said. They weren’t used to watching theatre and not so versed in how to respond – instead their responses were so honest and simple, cutting through to the core. It was really beautiful.” Were people not angry that he had been acting undercover? “Some people were, like, ‘Who does he think he is?’ But we can’t hide away from these things. I wanted to crack it open and see how people react.” Creed is thankful for many things hurling has given him. After he performed, the club chairman said to him: “If this game gave you nothing else, it’s helped you stand up in front of your teammates and tell your own story.” “And it did,” says Creed. “It taught me courage.” • Spliced is at Edinburgh Sports Club until 25 August."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 11.41 BST We may like to think we’re quite sexually free and equal these days, but an End Violence Against Women Coalition/YouGov survey of nearly 4,000 adults finds that two-fifths of people think men want sex more than women do. And between a third of and half of us think it is more likely that in heterosexual couples men will initiate and orgasm during sex, and decide when sex is finished, than women. In contrast, women are believed to be much more likely to refuse sex and to “go along with sex to keep their partner happy”. The 'orgasm gap' exists solely in heterosexual sex – lesbians are not having this problem This shows the persistence of the idea that sex is more “for” men than it is for women. The female climax is talked about in terms of being elusive, and yet the fact that this “orgasm gap” exists solely in heterosexual sex speaks to a lack of understanding, effort and mutuality, because lesbians are not having this problem. It’s a product of setting up the male orgasm, usually achieved through penile penetration, as the centrepiece of sex. It is a sad state of affairs that there is a lower expectation that women will experience pleasure or climax during sex, and that this is accepted as to be expected, or “normal”. It’s self-perpetuating, because if women believe that “going along” with sex is a common female experience, they may be less likely to articulate and explore their needs and wants in early sexual relationships or when older. They may also feel pressure not to express discomfort or pain. And when sex is only one part of a long-term relationship, alongside persistent inequality around work, chores, caring and other people’s gendered expectations, plain talking and yet another plea for fairness might be just one battle too many. Sexual inequality matters enormously, in and of itself, because women should be able to expect and enjoy sexual relationships that are based on mutual pleasure and equality. This shouldn’t need contesting or sound radical any more but apparently it does. But there’s even more than this at stake. The sexist ideas about sex that we identified can also be a basis for some men developing a sense of greater entitlement to sex, as well as the excusing or minimising of men pestering or pushing women for sex. If you combine these ideas that men want and need sex more, and that women are just less motivated and more likely to refuse, you end up with a toxic status for women as the “gatekeepers” of sex, where it is a woman’s role to manage sexual interactions and access to her body. If women are “gatekeepers” of whether sex takes place, then it is women who carry all the responsibility for every single sexual interaction they have. And this means that women are also seen as responsible if their boundaries are broken and they experience sexual violence. And it will be principally her who is investigated to ascertain whether a rape took place if she alleges it. The man’s behaviour apparently does not need close examination. It is assumed he will have been up for and will have pushed for sex – only 1% of people think men ever refuse sex, and 2% think men “go along with” sex. This can then lead to the rhetoric of sexual violence being set up as an unfortunate failure to properly gatekeep, a regret, just a big misunderstanding. These are powerful myths that have malign consequences. However, if we thought about sex differently, based on equality, these would be less likely. This entrenched sexism about sex matters when we consider what is going wrong in a society that is utterly failing to deter, reduce and prevent rape. These ideas are part of why reported rape prosecutions fail, as police and prosecutors decide they can’t build a case if they think a jury will see a woman who “failed to gatekeep” before they see a man who knew he was crossing the line. This is why we are calling for more, accelerated and frank conversations about actual sexual practice. We need men to recognise their responsibility and accept accountability both for sexism and for good sex. We need to put an end to the notion that sex is something done “to” women, and to reach a place where enthusiastic, mutual consent, equality and pleasure in sexual relationships is the norm. Sex will be so much better when it’s more equal. • Rebecca Hitchen is campaigns manager at the End Violence Against Women Coalition"
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/24/excellent-essex-gillian-darley-in-praise-of-britains-most-misunderstood-county,"Caught between London’s East End and a treacherous coastline, this much maligned terrain has a noble history of eccentrics and dissenters – and buildings to match Catherine Slessor Sat 24 Aug 2019 14.00 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.53 BST Casually derided for its loud mouth, bad taste and louche, estuarine ways, Essex is the whipping boy of England. Unlike Kent, the garden of England, and Surrey, its patio, Essex is not softened by ersatz pastoralism or laced with gin-and-Jag smugness. Charles Dickens once described Chelmsford, its administrative capital, as “the dullest and most stupid spot on the face of the earth”. Pinioned by water on one side and London on the other, Essex has a sense of being perpetually under siege from both the sea and the elephantine presence of the metropolis, “a seeping inkblot on the horizon” that over time has greedily gobbled up extremities such as Ilford and Romford. Threats of inundation and invasion have always weighed heavily on the Essex mind, most recently articulated by an unflinching urge to uncouple from Europe. Parsed and pored over by politicians, psephologists and the press, Essex is stubbornly unafraid to make manifest its discontent and go its own cussed way. But as Gillian Darley’s new biography of England’s most maligned and misunderstood county persuasively demonstrates, Essex is more than the crude caricature connoted by referendum statistics. Excellent Essex: In Praise of Britain’s Most Misunderstood County is a richly nuanced billet doux to a terrain populated and shaped by dissenters, eccentrics, witch-finders, Puritans, plotlanders and punks. Index entries for Colchester alone include: 1884 earthquake; Castle, witches held in; first civil partnership; Monopoly board; Oyster Feast; plague; suffragettes; Yokohama, trade with. You name it, it went on in Essex. My fleeting folk memory of Essex is of a grim, midwinter foray to a pet crematorium near Chipping Ongar And yes, there is an Essex edition of Monopoly, with the county’s historic houses such as Jacobean Audley End and Layer Marney Tower, Britain’s tallest Tudor gatehouse, up for grabs along with shopping centres and car dealerships. Colchester Castle remains the plum property, priced at £350. And the 1884 earthquake, which measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, remains Britain’s most destructive tremor, serendipitously begetting, as Darley relates, the Crittall window, the metal framed casement window designed by Frank Crittall that became so emblematic of modernism. Brought up on the Essex/Suffolk borders, architectural historian, critic and campaigner Darley makes a delightfully convivial and knowledgable sherpa. Her command of her multitudinous source material is enviably fluent and always illuminating, from the number of salt pans in Maldon recorded by the Domesday Book to the precise specifications of pargetting. It all fairly whirls along in a blizzard of detail, an experience akin to barrelling through Essex lanes in an open-topped sports car while Darley swigs from a hip flask yelling “Ask me anything!” In a more raucous and enjoyable way, she follows the path trod, or rather driven, by that other obsessive observer and compiler Nikolaus Pevsner, whose Buildings of England remains the definitive, if slightly arid, catalogue raisonné of the nation’s architecture. Yet unlike Darley, Pevsner was not a fan of Essex, arriving there in early 1950s, three years into his gruelling round-England odyssey, towing a caravan borrowed from Hubert de Cronin Hastings, his editor at the Architectural Review. Thus provisioned, he glumly did the rounds, taking in Essex’s Roman remains, its churches, its Martello towers to repel Napoleonic invasion, its factory towns and the oh-so-bracing seaside modernism of Frinton and Clacton. “He did not warm to it,” Darley drily notes. What Pevsner would have made of Quinlan Terry’s Roman Catholic cathedral in Brentwood, completed in 1991, a curious chimera of Italian Renaissance and English baroque motifs, is anyone’s guess. As well as Terry’s classical revivalist pile, Brentwood is also spiritual home to The Only Way Is Essex (the infamous Towie), marking, as Darley writes, “one more instance of those strange contradictions and odd bedfellows to which Essex is so cheerfully privy”. Another might be the 15th-century St Clement’s church in West Thurrock framed by the belching hulk of a Procter & Gamble soap plant, a juxtaposition so blatantly cinematic that it earned a spot in Four Weddings and a Funeral, as well as psychogeographic veneration by Iain Sinclair in London Orbital, his paean to the M25. My fleeting folk memory of Essex is more Pevsnarian than Darleyesque, of a grim, midwinter foray to a pet crematorium near Chipping Ongar. It seemed to confirm Essex’s potential for accommodating kitschly macabre rites in the middle of nowhere. Anything could be going on in those outhouses. And as Darley confirms, anything often was. Now a mildly unsettling tourist attraction, the three storey-deep “indestructible” secret nuclear bunker built at Kelvedon Hatch at the height of cold war hostilities masqueraded on the surface as an “inconspicuous farm cottage with a cosy dormer window in its tiled roof”. Decommissioned in 1992, it still pops up in television dramas that require a menacing subterranean locale. Existential dread casts a particularly deep and baleful shadow over Essex. Catastrophic flooding in 1953 killed 114 people in Jaywick and Canvey Island, with 32,000 evacuated. The “thieving sea” still nibbles ominously at a 350-mile coastline that weaves its implausibly intricate way along innumerable estuaries and inlets. Since the Romans tussled with Boudicca, Essex has also been in the front line of foreign invasion, and its coast and countryside are studded with concrete pillboxes and other decaying detritus of defence, such as Maunsell sea forts in the Thames estuary. Originally designed to house anti-aircraft guns, their carious hulks now make for especially salacious ruin porn. During the second world war, Audley End, historically the nearest thing to a palace Essex could muster, was requisitioned as a covert training college for Polish saboteurs, its 17th-century interiors temporarily encased in a protective skin of plywood. After the war, it was suggested this Saffron Walden fastness might become the official residence of the disgraced Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but they quickly found quarters more to their liking in Paris. The less palatial and newly constructed Butlin’s holiday camp at Clacton was also requisitioned as an internment camp for German civilians, while Warner’s at Dovercourt became a reception centre for Jewish children fleeing the Nazis following Kristallnacht. As the East End of London emptied into Essex after the war, its countryside became an energetic incubator of new towns, with their blissful compensations of light, air and indoor sanitation. Basildon, home of “Basildon man”, the cynosure of the Tory working-class voter, was masterplanned by Basil Spence, while in Harlow, Frederick Gibberd designed Britain’s first residential tower block, the 10-storey Lawn. More radically, the development of Essex’s new towns went hand in hand with a new “plate glass” university on the edge of Colchester. Kenneth Capon of Architects’ Co-Partnership was reportedly keen to disrupt the staid notion of a campus, insisting on “a certain amount of controlled vulgarity”. He described his intention behind the architecture as “to do something fierce”, a wish that was unintentionally fulfilled when its brutalist precincts became a crucible for vigorous student protest in the late 60s. Darley’s own odyssey concludes on a more conciliatory note, with a visit to the House for Essex, “a cottage for Rapunzel illustrated by Arthur Rackham”, designed by the architect Charles Holland and artist Grayson Perry, both Essex boys. Like Darley’s book, it is a love letter to the county, but framed through the prism of an Essex Everywoman, the fictional Julie Cope. Set in Wrabness, a pinprick hamlet on the northernmost extremity of Essex, the bijou micro-dwelling is an expressively confected tapestry of allusion, craft and storytelling that finds echoes in Darley’s vivid narrative of reclaiming and resituating. Contradictory and complex, Essex is never quite what it seems. Excellent Essex by Gillian Darley is published by Old Street Publishing, £14.99. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 21.53 BST Aston Villa coasted into the Carabao Cup third round, Dean Smith’s team soaking up some early pressure from Crewe before their class allowed them to pull away with ease. The manager was proud of his team’s approach. “I wanted to make sure the attitude was right and show the importance of what [the competition] is. We play for three trophies in a season – this, the FA Cup and the Premier League. “They caused us some problems, Dave [Artell] has got a young bright team here. Six-one is a really good result.” This was the fifth meeting of the sides, all taking place in knockout games, Crewe’s best result a 2-2 draw in January 1975 in this competition. Artell gave a debut to Rio Adebisi, an 18-year-old who lined up at left-back as one of four changes to the League Two team. Smith retained only Jota of the side that defeated Everton on Friday, Marvelous Nakamba, Ezri Konsa and Matt Targett making their debuts. Kortney Hause’s appearance was a first in Villa colours since joining permanently, the 24-year-old defender previously featuring for the club as a loanee from Wolves. Crewe’s Callum Ainley soon went down the right and placed a cross on to Charlie Kirk’s head but the blond forward could not keep the ball down, a miss soon to prove costly. Villa moved up the other end and a scramble ensued. Adebisi failed to clear when he should have done and Konsa was able to direct his header past the Crewe goalkeeper, David Richards. Crewe were contributing to a fast-paced tie. Owen Dale posed problems down the Villa right and Konsa needlessly headed the ball out for a corner in response to the home side’s pressure. When the set piece came in Chris Porter forced a sharp save from Jed Steer and the concession of a second corner, this one from the opposite side. The ball was played in and eventually Dale touched home from the goalline but he was ruled offside, the strike may have been legal without his intervention. Shortly Kirk warmed Steer’s fingers and the raucous crowd sensed an equaliser was coming. But instead disaster struck Crewe: Lansbury was allowed time by a slumbering defence and he found Conor Hourihane, who slid the ball into an unguarded goal, Richards’s positioning leaving him marooned. Villa now started to stroke the ball around and close to half-time Anwar El Ghazi found Hourihane who finished coolly again for his second. This meant Crewe were surely going out and Villa could enjoy the rest of the contest. Ainley was the first to offer a second-half threat, though his shot was off target and, when Dale was put clear, he too missed badly, to the keeper’s right. This had been the difference: Crewe were profligate, Villa far more ruthless. When Richards – who was having a difficult evening – dallied near his six-yard box Lansbury came close to pickpocketing the keeper and embarrassing him further. The lead came close to moving to four when El Ghazi raced in but his careful attempt cannoned off the left post. The sense was that Villa were toying with their opponents, moving in second gear. So it was that, when they applied the throttle, the end result was a close-range goal by Keinan Davis. The substitutes Frédéric Guilbert and Jack Grealish completed the scoring for the five-times winners, Ryan Wintle securing a consolation. Artell offered an honest appraisal. “We played well in patches, soft as crap in others,” he said. “The gulf in class was there at times, certainly towards the end.”"

Last modified on Thu 8 Aug 2019 02.10 BST Scientific studies do not find any links between video games and gun violence. The claim that they do has been repeatedly tested, studied and debunked. Yet on Monday, US president Donald Trump insisted that “gruesome and grisly video games” were causative in the gun massacre deaths of 22 people in El Paso and another 9 in Dayton (not Toledo) Ohio. Why scapegoat video games and demonise the people who play them? My dudes, why not? It’s established that science, expertise, evidence and the truth are not dominant themes of the Trump presidency, and with increasing numbers of people bleeding to death in US streets, he has to find someone – something – anything! – to blame … that isn’t the real reason. You know, that restrictions on the purchase of guns in America are so lax, you can just walk in and buy one at Walmart, a local store, a gun show or from a friend or neighbour. You can keep an assassination list, be a convicted petty felon or an extremist who dreams of a race war on Facebook, and still get legal hands on a gun. Trump has heavy investment in that laxity. Just before the 2016 election, he dared “those second-amendment people” – remember? – to act against Hillary Clinton if she attempted legislative gun control. The New York Times reported: “Mr Trump and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke; instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs Clinton.” People make a lot of claims about Trump’s intelligence, but in no context is the man stupid enough to piss off the (heavily armed) people he himself has fired up. So he’s blaming video games. It’s not even the most insulting wad of baloney smeared by apologists for an uncontrollable gun lobby over this lethal American moment. A Republican state congressional representative is out there insisting the preventable carnage is due to the nefarious influence of drag queens. Unlike drag queens, at least one or two small studies have concluded violent video games can provoke increased aggression. This correlates to my own experience – I play violent video games and readily testify to an adrenalin burst that attends the mowing down of mutants, killer robots and the digital undead. The feeling probably registers at about 10% of the hostility and rage with which I respond to seeing Trump demonise gamers because he is unwilling or uninterested to enact meaningful gun control. In fact, the night Trump was elected, I grappled for my PlayStation console and poured my disappointment into a zombie bloodbath – a safe, immersive place to expend emotional energy in a way that would have zero consequences in a real world of human beings. If Trump’s ilk appreciated anything about popular culture, high art or low, they’d know that it was precisely for reasons of processing emotions that early humanity invented things like “the theatre”, the entertainment from which video games draw their inheritance. If Trump really is concerned about the influence of video games, I expect his condemnations of Shakespeare to appear forthwith, given that cultural desensitisation to the violence of that entertainment is forced on children in schools. There’s lots of shooting in Call of Duty, but I’d suggest the forced removal of eyeballs (King Lear), mass poisonings (Hamlet), a mutilation-rape and cannibalism (Titus Andronicus) deliver bodily violations far more memorable. Then, of course, there’s the Christian Bible – somewhat aggressively marketed in America – whose bloody moments of baby-eating (Kings 6:28-29), foreskin mutilation (Exodus 4:24-25), gang rape (Judges 19:25) appear amid many scenes of mass murder, with Genesis 34:25-29 striking for homicidal inventiveness. The history of the United States itself makes violent reading, founded as it is on the genocide of its first nations people, as well as, you know, slavery. To be consistent, Trump really should denounce the lot. He’s not going to, because consistency and coherency are not the preserve of a leader prepared to denounce video games when he couldn’t name 10. He’ll condemn gaming hot off a teleprompter, but struggle to hook up an Xbox. That guy is uninterested in figures that show 60% of Americans are daily gamers, yet not 60% of the population are shooting each other. Or that 45% of American gamers are women, but 96.2% of mass shooter incidents are committed by men. Or that 70% of American parents says video games have been good for their kids. Or that these demographics of gamers are comparable in Australia, where they play the very same games but have very strict gun laws. Australia has had one mass shooter incident – with an illegal firearm – in one year, while the United States has had 255. Or that not every shooter is a gamer, but what every shooting has in common is a gun. At the time of Trump’s election, much was made of how his adviser Steve Bannon energised male gamers behind Trump. Bannon’s propaganda victory was to mobilise a community miffed by the intrusion of feminism and other social movements into game spaces to support the white, male authoritarian Trump brand. Well, boys, you got the authoritarianism you voted for. Now that there’s blood on the streets, Trump’s blaming you. The way he plays this game is not going to change. But maybe – just maybe – you can. • Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 09.11 BST So much has changed since the last time Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova stared each other down from across the net, fists pumped and teeth bared as growls vibrated from their throats. After falling to Wiliams for a 19th time in their 2016 Australian Open quarter-final, Sharapova walked off the court and took the drug test that would change her life. A year later, Williams returned to Melbourne pregnant and tore through the draw without dropping a set. In the years since, both women have failed to match those results for different reasons, but under the lights of the Arthur Ashe Stadium in the most absurd first-round draw in recent history, there was a sense of familiarity as Williams demolished Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 to move up 20-2 in one of the most famous head-to-heads of all time. The shock of the draw and the build-up to Monday night combined to mark a opening-round occasion unlike almost any other. Beyond the obsession with their mutual animosity and the endless debates over whether a matchup with a 19-2 record deserves to be branded a rivalry, this is an important match because of their success. Since their first meeting in 2004, they are the two most successful female players of the past 15 years. Williams stands light years ahead of Sharapova and the rest with her record 23 slams, but also no player since Sharapova has been able to consistently contend for and win big titles as she did for many years. “Obviously, I’m going against a player that has won five Grand Slams and been in the final of many more and that’s not easy,” said Williams on-court after her victory. “So every practice after that was super intense.” As the pair prepared to walk onto the court, Williams approached pre-match interviewer Rennae Stubbs with smile on her face, and she played with a similar relaxedness throughout. The American opened the match with an unreturned serve then held with a forehand winner. Sharapova followed suit, punctuating her opening hold with a loud cheer. There would be little else to celebrate. As is so often the case, Williams and Sharapova seemed to be playing different matches. As an intense Sharapova fired missiles hard and flat, desperately trying to take control of the match, Williams amped up her serve but otherwise played calmly within herself. Rather than relying on her power, she rushed Sharapova with depth and viciously moved the ball from side to side, forcing the Russian onto the run. Sharapova knew that high-risk tactics were her only chance against a stronger, faster and more intelligent opponent, but they were responsible for her countless errors throughout. Successive backhand and forehand errors gave Williams the first break at 3-1, then Sharapova offered up the second break with a netted backhand. By the end of the first set, Williams had struck nine winners to a near-flawless three unforced errors. Despite her aggression, Sharapova managed just three winners to 10 unforced errors. In the second set, Sharapova began to find her range and pushed the six-time US Open champion more, but only in select games. The Russian generated two break points down 6-1, 2-1, but Williams scuppered both, saving the second with a running backhand down the line passing shot. Even the American’s movement, an issue since her comeback, seemed elevated against her bitter foe. Williams then took Sharapova’s insolence as an insult, rising to another level with her noise and intensity augmented as she broke quickly for a 6-1, 4-1 lead. Sharapova generated four more break points at 6-1, 4-1, but each time Williams found a first serve or forced Sharapova into a difficult position or else came up with a winner of her own. It was the same sequence that has played out too many times since Williams’ 6-1, 6-2 slaughter of Sharapova in the 2007 Australian Open final, the match that flipped their encounters from battles to beatdowns. “It’s not an easy road. It’s never been,” Sharapova said. “But I went through a shoulder procedure about four months ago. To find myself playing at a night match at the US Open with people excited about the matchup, it’s a pretty big deal. I’m fortunate to be a part of that. It’s easy to be discouraged after a match like this. But if I’m personally discouraged, I wake up tomorrow, I don’t feel like I want to go out, train, be better, that’s more discouraging than the result.” After straight-sets losses in three successive slam finals, most recently a 6-2, 6-2 defeat to Simona Halep in the Wimbledon final, Williams has spent much of 2019 searching for the mental strength that has defined her career. In January, after failing to convert match points and losing to Karolina Pliskova in the Australian Open quarter-finals, she felt like she needed to rediscover her ruthlessness in the big moments, or, in her words, how to “go psycho”. Monday night’s display was a throwback to days long gone when Williams’ dominance seemed so natural. As she progresses in the tournament, it may just have helped her remember what it’s like to put her foot on an opponent’s neck in a high stakes match and to never let go."

First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 10.41 BST British Airways has drafted in almost 100 extra staff to deal with a flood of complaints from customers trying to rebook flights and chase refunds in the run-up to next month’s pilot strikes. The airline said it had about 730 staff handling thousands of calls and social media messages after customers were told their flights would be affected by pilot walkouts on 9, 10 and 27 September. About 640 customer service workers usually handle queries on a normal day. A number of passengers received emails from the airline on Friday mistakenly telling them their flights were affected. Many scrambled to arrange alternative flights – only to learn hours later that the email was sent in error and their original travel plans were unaffected. Customers who were expected to fly on strike days have been given the option to rebook or receive a full refund but BA said customers affected by the email error would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. When an airline starts cancelling or delaying flights for more than three hours, passengers are entitled to compensation of €250-€600 (£230-£550) under EU rules. The cause of the problem has to be under the airline’s control and not an ‘extraordinary circumstance’. Lack of planes/staff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline’s control – so compensation is payable. Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights – up to 1,500km – are entitled to €250 or £230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to €400, and €600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km). Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive. Passengers are also entitled to ‘assistance’ under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline’s fault. The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not. The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers. What will happen after Brexit is not yet clear. Miles Brignall Numerous passengers said they were struggling to get through to customer services after the pilot walkouts were confirmed on Friday. It came after BA failed to settle a long-running dispute with the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa), with the union calling for a 11.5% pay rise for members over three years. BA said it received more than 60,000 phone calls and 52,000 Twitter messages over the bank holiday weekend, when it had 500 customer service staff on hand. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said: “BA must urgently get its act together and ensure that anyone whose flight is cancelled is rerouted, regardless of whether it is with a different airline or not. “The airline also needs to do right by passengers who spent hundreds of pounds on new flights when they were wrongly told that their original flights had been cancelled and make sure they are not left out of pocket.” The company was deluged with Twitter messages, as customers complained they were missing weddings, holidays and honeymoons as a result of the strikes. One customer tweeted that they had been unable to use the online booking system in the three days since the pilot strike was confirmed and were unable to get through to BA customer service by phone. “Shame on you,” the user said. @British_Airways is the worst. 3 days since the #bastrike announcement, the online booking system is still down and I cannot get through the BA customer service (in any country) to rebook. Shame on you. “I’m up to over 30 call attempts. Just get cut off. Ironic that it’s your 100th birthday as your customer service is straight from the early 20th century,” another complained. A BA spokesperson said: “We’re extremely sorry that some of our customers are having difficulties trying to rearrange their flights. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help as many of our customers as possible in these unprecedented circumstances. “Our teams have been providing our customers with as many options as possible, as quickly as possible, including a full refund or rebooking to a different date of travel or airline.” The Civil Aviation Authority has been in contact with British Airways over how it has dealt with customers affected by cancellations. “[We] are seeking an explanation to confirm how it complied with its rerouting obligations to consumers,” said the regulator’s director, Richard Stephenson. Customers should be offered reimbursement for cancelled flights, alternative travel arrangements that included flights on other airlines or a new flight at a convenient date , the CAA said. “We also expect airlines to proactively provide passengers with information about their rights when flights are cancelled.” The authority said passengers who were mistakenly told their flights were cancelled should not be left out of pocket and that any reasonable cost of rebooking flights should be claimed from British Airways."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/21/felice-gimondi-obituary,"One of the greats of Italian cycling who won the 1965 Tour de France when he was only 22 William Fotheringham Wed 21 Aug 2019 16.48 BST


Last modified on Wed 21 Aug 2019 18.05 BST Felice Gimondi, who has died of a heart attack aged 76, was one of Italy’s greatest cycling champions of the postwar era, a precociously young winner of the Tour de France who was widely viewed as the successor to the legendary “Campionissimo” Fausto Coppi. However, along with every professional cyclist racing between 1966 and 1976, Gimondi was unfortunate to be competing when Eddy Merckx was in his prime; in spite of that he built a palmarès (prize list) that places him in the top 10 cyclists of all time. In 1964 Gimondi rode the Tokyo Olympic Games – as did Merckx – and went on to win that year’s Tour de l’Avenir, a mini version of the Tour de France for riders under 25 – currently it is for people under 23. The following year he became the only rider to win the Avenir and the Tour itself in successive seasons, when he took the Tour at the age of 22; until Egan Bernal’s victory this year, Gimondi remained the youngest Tour winner in the postwar era. Gimondi’s Avenir title had earned him a professional contact with the Salvarani squad and as a novice he was not expected to gain a ride in the Tour de France even though he finished third in the Giro d’Italia in the spring of 1965, a surprising result for a debutant. But a teammate withdrew shortly before the start of the Tour and Gimondi was called up; he recalled later that he had had to ask his mother for her permission to race. In the absence of the five-times winner Jacques Anquetil, that year’s Tour was expected to be won by the “eternal second” Raymond Poulidor, but Gimondi surprised everyone by taking the yellow jersey on stage three into Rouen. He was expected to be a caretaker until his teammate Vittorio Adorni stepped up, and relinquished the lead for a couple of days after waiting with the rest of Salvarani when Adorni crashed. Eventually Adorni pulled out, and Poulidor became the big threat, but Gimondi hung on up the notorious Mont Ventoux and then sealed the title with victory in the final time trial. The following season, he turned his attention to one-day racing, taking the Paris-Roubaix cobbled classic with an epic 42km solo break. He added the marathon Paris-Brussels and at the end of the season outsprinted Anquetil and Merckx to win the Giro di Lombardia. In 1967 he won the Giro d’Italia, and the following year he became the only cyclist along with Anquetil to win all three major Tours: France, Italy, Spain. Since then, only five others have managed the triple in their careers, most recently Britain’s Chris Froome. Gimondi was born into a working-class family near Bergamo; his father ran a small transport business, while his mother delivered the local post by bicycle, prompting the disapproval of the local priest. He began racing in 1959 – having been forced to ride his first bike barefoot – and won his first race on 1 May 1960, a few months after Coppi’s early death had rocked Italy; four years later he began an enduring connection with the Bianchi cycle company – celebrated for its links with Coppi – when Coppi’s former mechanic approached him to race for the amateur team. After his triumphs of 1967, Gimondi was still only 25, but unfortunately for him, that was the season when Merckx attained maturity. He was to dominate the sport until 1975 leaving slender pickings for the likes of Gimondi, who beat the Belgian head to head only a few times, most notably in the 1973 world championship at Barcelona, when the “Cannibal” and his teammate Freddy Maertens were unable to combine to good effect in the finish. After 1968, most of his biggest victories came when Merckx was either indisposed (the 1976 Giro), absent (the 1974 Milan-San Remo), or won but was subsequently dis- qualified for doping – the 1969 Giro and the 1973 Lombardia. Like all the best cyclists of the Merckx era, Gimondi was doomed to be a doughty adversary rather than a prolific winner, but his duels won him deep affection and tributes in songs by Enrico Ruggeri (Gimondi e il Cannibale) and Elio e le Storie Tese (Sono Felice). After retirement in 1978, Gimondi set up an insurance company, but remained close to his sport through work for the Bianchi cycle company. On their behalf he was an elegant, seigneurial presence at most of the major races. Through Luciano Pezzi, he kept a direct link with Bianchi’s sponsored riders, most notably Marco Pantani, who in 1998 became the first Italian to win the Tour since Gimondi himself 33 years earlier. In 1968, Gimondi married Tiziana Bersano, whose parents ran a small hotel in Liguria, and were friends with his teammate Adorni; their relationship had blossomed after Salvarani used the hotel for a training camp. The couple had two daughters, Norma and Federica; all three survive him. • Felice Gimondi, cyclist, born 29 September 1942; died 16 August 2019"

Some are natural storytellers, gossips even; others get a kick out of unsettling the mighty. Some simply want to find things out to satisfy their natural curiosity. Most want to think their work has real-world impact, though I must confess that an awful lot of things I have written over the years have passed through this world without touching the sides. Usually it is the investigative types, the diggers and undercover reporters whose revelations lead to the biggest change, a minister toppled, a policy reversed. But not always. One of the many joys of editing the Guardian’s Upside series – optimistic journalism that focuses on solutions, initiatives, innovations, people making a difference – is that it often ripples back out into the world it reported on, inspiring readers to take action, generating change for the better. For me, this is urgently needed in a world where a surfeit of dismal news – a crisis crisis if you like – is demoralising audiences as never before. We surely won’t fix the world if we keep on telling people that everything is rotten, hopeless, unfixable. While we have a duty to inform and educate society on where we are going wrong, we feel it is only proper we should point out where it is going right too. When we do, when we show what is possible, it can have a powerful virtuous effect on the lives of the people we write about. For example, earlier this year, we published the story of a pioneering group of Yazidi women who set up a female-only community in Syria as a safe space from the hideous violence and abuse they had faced at the hands of Isis. Within hours, emails were pouring in from readers asking how they could support the community. We gathered them together in a WhatsApp group and put them in touch with community leaders, so they could figure out how best to send money. One reader, Gill Whittaker, said the aim was “to do something together … Thus a more certain ‘upside’ outcome may be achieved”. Another example: last year we wrote about the Remakery, a cafe in Edinburgh that also fixes your broken appliances while you wait. Almost 100,000 people shared the article on social media. The piece became part of a virtuous circle, with people around the world getting in touch with the owner, Sophie Unwin, asking how they could set up a franchise in their city. “As a result of the piece I had more inquiries from across the UK (Nottingham, Brighton and elsewhere) and also internationally (one group in Montreal, others in the US) and I think a few others in Europe and New Zealand too,” Unwin told us. “Some people directly referenced the Guardian feature and said they found it inspiring. “We’ve received other funding and are in conversation with other potential partners – there is a lot of interest. I would argue that the article also helped raise the wider agenda, as evidenced by news like Ikea’s work on the circular economy. Repair culture is moving more into the mainstream, which has always been one of the aims of this work.” When we wrote about an obscure cleric who drives around Iran’s poorest province bringing books to children, enough people were touched to club together and buy him a new car for his rounds. “This was a particularly cheering and hopeful piece in a climate of nastiness and Brexit tedium,” wrote Paul MacGowan. “I wonder if you could let me know if it’s possible for me to send donations to support his work?” A piece about paint recycling prompted no end of tips (and jokes) from readers. An article about an African environmentalist generated offers of legal support and a UN promise to champion her case. A focus on tree-planting in Niger brought inquiries from farmers in southern Africa. Best practice doesn’t always spread itself. The Upside has sought to deepen this connection between readers and subjects through a weekly newsletter, which attracts a prodigious digital mail bag each week. We continuously encourage our 30,000 subscribers to get in touch with alternatives, ideas and suggestions. When they do, others can be moved to get involved. “One of the pleasures was reading about the Green Ukhiya Star Team in The Upside,” wrote Beverley Colgan recently, referring to a little known Bangladeshi group planting 1m trees in the country’s south-east. “I went to their Facebook page but it had no big, obvious ‘contribute’ button.” We put Beverley in touch with the tree planters. Readers come up with great solutions, too. When we asked what people were doing to cut their carbon, we had hundreds of responses. The innovative things individuals are doing in a dozen countries around the world prompted more readers to write in and commit to flying less, cycling more or eating less meat. When we asked people for their favourite foreign word that is hard to render into English, it threw up many ideas, notions, tendencies and instincts that some cultures have that others could benefit from. (My own favourites: saudade, turangawaewae, philotimo). The media must recognise it shapes the world we live in, as well as reflecting it. Hyperbolic coverage of terrorists and school shooters and people who take their own lives will encourage copycats. Hysterical coverage of populism, recession and mental illness risk turning into self-fulfilling prophecy. But the same is true of optimism. Writing about inspiring characters – environmentalists, health workers, inventors and unsung heroes – will encourage more young people to follow in their footsteps. When we report progress, more progress ensues. What better way to change the world?"
https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/25/regina-bistecca-florence-jay-rayner-restaurant-review,"There’s so much to enjoy in this most beautiful city, but little to match this glorious slab of meat Jay Rayner Sun 25 Aug 2019 05.59 BST Regina Bistecca, Via Ricasoli 14r, Florence 50122, Italy (+39 055 269 3772; reginabistecca.com). Starters €8-€14, main courses €15-€29, T-bone steaks for two to share €60-€90, wines from €23 Dusk falls in Florence at the end of another oven-baked day and from dozens of apparently identical trattorias, crisp-shirted waiters step. Behind them, in chilled glass cabinets, stand the curving waves of amber-fatted beef, with muscle the colour of plum. Their job is to get you through the door. They want you to spend the big money on a steak the size of your head. But whose call should you heed? Charcoal grilled to a thrilling shade of rust and brown, the steak is placed on the table so we can worship Florence, which I’ve been visiting for more than 35 years, is a city besotted by its past. I set my first novel here, and wrote most of it here, too, in a room overlooking the waters of the Arno. It made me feel like a proper writer. The book was an ambitious little number about art history and the market in expertise, which is what Florence has traded on since Vasari first published The Lives of the Artists in 1550. I spent my mornings wandering galleries, staring at masterpieces and attempting to have profound, writerly thoughts. Being belly-led, however, I was easily distracted. I soon found Florence had other things to recommend it: the deep, peppery way with tripe, long-stewed in a tomato broth; the porchetta buns sold in the covered market, the robust loaves first dipped in vats of meaty juices to soften them up; the pasta dishes and the gelato (ice-cream doesn’t quite do it justice). And, of course, the bistecca alla Fiorentina. For years I avoided the latter. I loved the idea of a prime T-bone from a lovingly reared animal, with which the callus-handed Tuscan farmer had been on first-name terms, but I was terrified of getting a dud. It’s exactly what happened the first time I ordered one, in some gaudy trattoria close to the Ponte Vecchio. I was in prime tourist territory; I got a tourist’s steak. It was a tough, stringy lump of neglected meat. It was a terrible waste both of cash and animal. It’s not an unfamiliar story: where do you go for the best paella in Valencia or the best bouillabaisse in Marseille? How do we, as tourists, pile through the rip-offs and the ersatz and the come-hithers to the good stuff? Where Florence and its T-bone are concerned, let me help. I was directed to the relatively new Regina Bistecca – literally Queen Steak – and I, in turn, am directing you there. They served me one of the very best slabs of beef I have ever eaten. Others will have their favourites; this is now mine. It occupies what was, for 140 years, the antiquarian bookseller Gonnelli, just behind the duomo. At the front, overlooking the bar, they have kept the gallery with its bookshelves now filled with wine bottles. Beyond, in an arched space, painted a cooling shade of olive green, is the main dining room. Get a table towards the back and you may be able to see the grill at work, flames gusting upwards just beyond the kitchen’s glass wall. The menu keeps to the Florentine classics. Offal, or the “fifth quarter”, is represented by ox tongue with salsa verde, or a salad of tripe. There are bruschetta and pasta dishes. There are salamis and cheeses from nearby. A plate of Calabrian salted anchovies arrives and, with it, warm toast with curls of unsalted butter on ice. It is one of the few occasions when unsalted butter makes sense. Spread the chilled butter thickly and add the meaty anchovies. It’s bliss on toast. We also have crudités, ribbons of fennel, celery and carrot cut just so, to be dipped into balsamic vinegar and peppery olive oil. We have ordered lightly. We intend to do justice to the main event. There are three breeds of beef here, from Scottish Black Angus at €4.90 per 100g to the local Chianina at €8.20. We are directed to the one in between, the equally local Marchigiana at €6.80. The restaurant manager, Marco, spent years in London, latterly at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen, and returned only a few months ago. He knows how to chat up a Londoner. He tells us the Marchigiana is fattier than the more expensive cut and therefore less tough. To prove it, he brings the 1kg steaks tableside, so we can coo over the marbling like proper beef pervs. Let me address those who are repulsed: some of us eat meat. That’s something you will have to cope with. But if you’re going to eat beef, it should be rarely and the very best you can afford, from well-cared-for animals. Those who want to lecture me are welcome to do so. Carry on. I will then sit in the corner and think very seriously about my life choices, perhaps for much of next week. The Florentines generally ask for their steaks cooked to a rareness from which it might be possible to detect a pulse. Don’t be afraid to ask for yours a little better done. It’s your dinner. Their medium-rare is our rare. It returns, half an hour later, charcoal grilled to a thrilling shade of rust and brown. It is sliced up, seasoned with salt and pepper and olive oil and placed on a pedestal on the table between us so we can worship. Then we eat. There is a ripe minerality to the meat, and a crispness to the fat that crunches and melts. There are frazzled bits along the bone that we shall not let escape. We cut them off with our knives in long ribbons of finely caramelised beef. There are no gristly bits to be left discreetly on the side of the plate. It is all deeply flavoured and encouraging. It’s bloody gorgeous, in both senses. The various sauces – the peppercorn, the tarragon-laced béarnaise, the butter flecked with chives – makes this feel like a Tuscan steak house which has passed through New York or London on its holidays, and to good effect. It is the steak you wish for but so rarely get. Alongside we have a simple rocket salad and a bowl of Florentine “roast potatoes”, which are the usual disappointing pallid cubes. Don’t worry. For carbs there is an old-school dessert trolley, with profiteroles or cheesecake or a torta della nonna filled with crème pâtissière, if you can find the space. There’s some of Chianti’s finest at unthreatening prices. Most of all there is the gentle buzz of a dining room filled with people, content that they have found their way to the right place. If you’re ever in Florence, please do join them. You’ll thank me. If you’re in Florence during the summer you’ll need to cool down, possibly three times a day, and its gelato bars are the solution. I first went to the Festival del Gelato on Via del Corso in 1982, and I keep going back. The fruity end of the counter is, for me, where the action is; there’s nothing better engineered to sort you out when it’s 40C than a €2.50 tub of properly sharp lemon sorbet. But there are dozens to choose from including vegan options.On 28 September Leicester’s National Space Centre is partnering with the RNIB for a five-course dinner completely in the dark.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/15/how-bridezilla-became-this-summers-biggest-sexist-slur,"They tell bridesmaids to lose weight, force fiances into second jobs – and one reportedly asked a friend to have an abortion. Bridezilla stories are tabloid catnip, but what do they tell us? Emine Saner Thu 15 Aug 2019 10.30 BST It is wedding season, and as surely as an Ed Sheeran-soundtracked first dance follows a street-food-truck meal, stories of brides behaving badly are keeping the internet stoked. There is a whole group on the forum Reddit devoted to tales of so-called bridezillas. Newspapers devour them like a slice of naked wedding cake. Last month, a screengrabbed picture of a text conversation between a bride trying to force her cousin to be a bridesmaid before telling her she was “too fat anyways” was posted. Another post related how a woman had tried to force her fiance to get a second job to fund their wedding. There was also the story of a woman who posted the picture of her engagement ring – which once belonged to her partner’s grandmother – complaining it wasn’t what she had wanted, and the woman who complained her bridesmaids didn’t want to pay for their dresses. Earlier this year was the story of the bride-to-be who asked her pregnant bridesmaid to consider having an abortion so as not to complicate the dress fittings, and the bride who forced her friends to take a polygraph test. She wanted to find out which one of them had leaked details of her planned dress code, in which colours were allocated according to weight. Whether or not these tales – usually anonymous – are true, in WhatsApp groups over the country, women are prefacing any request of their bridesmaids with “not to be a bridezilla or anything, but …” “I won’t stand for it,” says Mark Niemierko, a wedding planner, of outlandish demands. Only recently, he says, he took a bride-to-be to one side and asked her to stop being so rude to his suppliers. When he talks to other people in the industry, they do share stories of overly-demanding brides, though he adds it has become such a well-worn – and feared – stereotype that the bridezilla has started to die out. It came about, he thinks, with the advent of celebrity weddings. He blames David and Victoria Beckham, and their 1999 wedding – with its golden thrones, outfit changes, balloon release and fireworks – for starting the modern trend for wanting the biggest and flashiest do, along with all the stressful organisation and cost that entails. The worst behaviour he has seen from couples “comes from being somewhat insecure and more so, keeping up with the Joneses”. The term bridezilla, likening brides to the fearsome Godzilla, the giant lizard-like sea monster from the 1954 Japanese film, had emerged four years before the Beckhams’ wedding in a newspaper article in the Boston Globe about demanding brides. It peaked around 2009, with the film Bride Wars, in which Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson try to sabotage each other’s weddings. And yet, 10 years on, the unhinged bridezilla has become as much a fixture of the wedding picture as that other monstrous female stereotype, the hostile mother-in-law. “We get a slew of news stories about out-of-control brides making ridiculous demands,” says Jilly Kay, a lecturer in media and communication at the University of Leicester, “and I think what it tells us more about is not that there is an epidemic of hysterical bridezillas, but that our culture is really uncomfortable with the idea of women having power and also women being angry. It speaks to this deep anxiety we seem to have with women who assert themselves, want to take control and have a voice.” Alena Amato Ruggerio, an associate professor of communication at Southern Oregon University and editor of the book Media Depictions of Brides, Wives and Mothers, came across the term when it was used as the title of a US reality show in 2004, showing the extreme behaviour of brides-to-be. Why has the stereotype been so enduring? “It taps into longstanding stereotypes about women,” she says. “That, under pressure, a woman is going to have a meltdown.” A woman, particularly a heterosexual woman, is supposed to view her wedding day as an achievement, something she has been encouraged to “dream” about – through stories and films – since she was a child. It is supposed to be perfect. “And when it’s impossible to live up to those standards, we’re going to sit back and enjoy watching the drama of her stress.” She can’t win, says Ruggerio. “On the one hand, a woman is supposed to have high standards in order to make all the arrangements and manage all the details; she’s being asked to exert a lot of power, but even just being able to display that competence can be a threatening display in a sexist society.” The term bridezilla, says the writer and feminist Joan Smith, “brings together a number of things, which is a rather old-fashioned idea of femininity, women apparently behaving in a trivial way and also being assertive. Those things together are always very easy to set up as a target.” There is also the irreconcilable idea that women are not supposed to seek attention, while also being the centre of attention on their wedding day (although a mute, virginal figure). “They’re spending a fortune on the dress and they want people to look at them and admire them, and women are not supposed to do any of that, even though the commercial pressure to do all that is very large.” Smith points out she is from a generation of women who did not want to get married, and certainly there are opportunities for resistance. “You don’t necessarily have to subscribe to all of those cultural standards of what a wedding is supposed to look like,” says Ruggerio. But the $300bn global wedding industry – not to mention the deluge of Instagram pictures and Pinterest boards – continues to push the idea of what a wedding is supposed to look like. Sophia Kingston, an administrator from Somerset, is getting married in two years’ time and is already heavily involved in planning her wedding. Her boyfriend is helping but she is doing the majority of the work. She says she didn’t think there was much danger of turning into a bridezilla “until I realised I am going to end up becoming one, because it’s hard to plan a wedding and juggle work, and it’s hard not to freak out about costings and guest lists. I didn’t realise how easy it would be to become one.” One of her friends has already called her bridezilla. “I hate it,” she says. “Even as a joke.” There is no groomzilla in popular culture – or if there is, it is said as a joke. But often, says Niemierko, it can be the men, particularly those with a lot of money to spend, who can be as bad as any tabloid bridezilla. “And they can be even worse,” he says. He has seen grooms insist on attending dress fittings, or turning the wedding into a networking event, inviting clients and people he is trying to impress. “He is going to have that ridiculous firework display and show off, and outdo his friend’s wedding he went to last year.” The British reality show Don’t Tell the Bride, in which the groom takes on all the wedding planning to surprise his wife-to-be, only works because we take it as a given that it is the woman who should really be organising their wedding, and the stakes are so high because it is supposedly the most important day of her life. When a groom on the show is throwing a tantrum or making impossible demands of his best man, nobody suggests he is becoming a monster. In the UK, the average cost of a wedding is about £30,000. “I’ve spent the past eight years working with brides-to-be, some of whom had £7k to spend, many of whom had well over £100k to spend,” says Jade Beer, a former editor of Conde Nast Brides and author of The Almost Wife. “But regardless, their attention to detail is what is consistently staggering. These women are deeply impressive. Every one of us could learn from their work ethic.” Imagine juggling the dietary requirements of more than 100 guests, she says. “Some tell horror stories of guests flying in from multiple foreign destinations and expecting the bride to assume the role of tour operator.” The bulk of organising a wedding is still viewed as the woman’s job, Kay points out. “It’s not just project management, in terms of running this multi-faceted event, but all the emotional labour that has to go into it – negotiating complex family politics and making sure that everybody’s happy,” she says. If some women snap under the pressure, it is hardly surprising, but the trope of bridezilla says more about how we view “women’s work”. “It’s part of the way we don’t value the kind of emotional labour women are doing all the time,” says Kay. Of course there will be some women who have acted in horrendous ways while trying to create some idealised perfect day, but the fear of being criticised for having demands or wishes, has a wider, pernicious impact. “The trope of the bridezilla,” says Kay, “does a lot of ideological work in trying to keep women in their place.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/25/a-diet-app-for-kids-is-hard-to-swallow,"It’s marketed as wellness, but should children really be counting calories? Sun 25 Aug 2019 09.00 BST


Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 13.31 BST Last September Weight Watchers changed its name. It had already rebranded, having dropped 600,000 subscribers and shifted its focus to “wellness” rather than diets, so a name change was not a huge surprise. But what was a surprise was its insistence that the new name, WW, doesn’t stand for anything, not even its new tagline: Wellness that Works. It stands for nothing. The company is back in the news this week with the launch of a new diet app for children. Which, well. There are small cultural touchpoints that when pressed today cause a sort of shudder, as if you’ve found an existential bruise. Certain handbags, for example, or prime ministers. Pete Doherty. Reading Candace Bushnell’s new book I felt one such shudder. Even though the first time round few of us identified with either the Sex and the City archetypes of womanhood or their ambitions of love (distinguished through huge wealth or big dicks) and friendship (distinguished through aspirational brunch items), we understood their mainstream appeal. Today Is There Still Sex in the City? with its reductive acronyms and designer vaginas arrives with embarrassment and the smell of burning. Like “WW” and its continued rebranding of what health looks like, seeing its flaws from this distance is shocking in its simplicity. We stand aghast beside a bonfire of vanities. You see patterns form in how businesses like this scrabble in muck to stay relevant. Like the characters in Bushnell’s new book, WW is shrouding outdated body obsessions in modern, muddled ideas of wellness. But in daylight the money shows through, and their latest launch, Kurbo, a calorie-counting app for kids, is not just old-fashioned but distinctly icky. Kurbo ranks food choices using a “traffic-light” system: green items can be eaten freely; yellow foods should be consumed in moderate portions; and red foods should make kids “stop and think”. The idea of my five-year-old “stopping” before accepting a KitKat, and “thinking” before quietly inputting it into an app, fills me with ancient dread. After “healthy eating week” at her school, I saw indignant confusion before a plate of biscuits. Food had become moralised – sweets tasted good, but were bad, and broccoli vice versa. Though the lessons were well-meaning, they proved confusing for shallow-fried brains, and she lectured me at length and wrongly about fat and sugar, talking over my quiet argument for a balanced plate. I was reminded, wearily, that eating is about so much more than food. The idea of my five-year-old 'stopping' before accepting a KitKat fills me with ancient dread In 2018, Weight Watchers announced it was taking the emphasis off before and after pictures, but on the Kurbo site, their “success stories” are cheerily illustrated with just that, including photos of Sophie, aged eight, drinking a milkshake, then… not (“I feel like I have more energy!”) – the small print below reads: “Results not typical”. For a weight-loss company struggling to place itself in a culture that’s turning away from diets, this is a clear attempt to soak up customers concerned about childhood obesity, with the app presumably marketed directly to their database of long-term dieters. But encouraging kids to focus on weight loss has been proven to trigger increased body dissatisfaction. Phones have a place in this – a 2019 study of 100 young people using nutrition apps found that almost half reported negative feelings, like guilt and obsession. WW’s app has launched in the US despite recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidelines explicitly warn parents and healthcare providers about the risks of focusing on weight loss with children and adolescents, in part because dieting increases the risk of eating disorders exponentially. American teenagers who diet are up to 18 times more likely to develop an eating disorder, compared to those who don’t. And eating disorders in children are increasing: in 2018 the number of children and young people entering treatment for an eating disorder was 30% higher than two years earlier. But the thing that makes me roll my eyes (rather, perhaps, than stick them with a fork) is the fact that diets don’t work. The majority of dieters end up weighing more than they did before. The whole concept is a scam the size of the Fyre festival, an idea built on sand. In order to sort out kids’ health, there are things we can do at home, like improve our own relationships with food and appearance, and there are things we can do in society, like contribute to political change that helps the most deprived families, those more affected by childhood obesity. This app is a throwback to those days when we bent to fit the lies we were told, rather than questioned their motives. And if we lived in a different kind of world, where bellies were not judged like garden vegetables, the value of a person based on more than appearance, perhaps a health app like this would work. But we live here, among the chips and pain, and in this world, a child should not be told to change their body. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/24/mutant-sheep-may-help-cure-batten-disease-roslin-institute-genetic-research,"Roslin Institute scientists create a flock to mimic human gene that causes Batten disorder Robin McKie Science Editor Sat 24 Aug 2019 14.00 BST


Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 23.23 BST Scientists have created a flock of sheep that carry the gene for a lethal inherited brain disorder in humans. The condition, Batten disease, usually starts in childhood and is invariably fatal, often within a few years of diagnosis. The project, which is designed to test treatments for the disease, is based at Edinburgh University’s Roslin Institute, where cloning techniques were used to create Dolly the sheep in 1996. The scientists acknowledge that the approach could be controversial as it involves creating animals programmed to die, but stress that their aim is to alleviate human suffering. “We have deliberately re-created the condition in a large mammal because sheep have a brain of a similar size and complexity to that of a child,” said Tom Wishart, project leader. “That means treatments we test on them are much more likely to be relevant to humans than those tested only on cell cultures or mice and rats.” In the UK, Batten disease affects between 100 and 150 children and young adults. It is inherited from two symptomless parents who each carry a rare recessive gene mutation. That mutation interferes with the operation of lysosomes, which act as the waste disposal systems for cells. Children who carry two copies of the faulty gene begin to suffer loss of vision, impaired cognition and mobility problems. Seizures and early death follow. “It is devastating for families,” Wishart said. There are several types of Batten disease, he added. “One of the more rapid types is CLN1, and that’s what we have recreated in our sheep.” The Roslin scientists used the gene-editing technique Crispr-Cas9 to create the faulty CLN1 gene in the sheep. “We collected sheep embryos from the abattoir,” Wishart said. “Then we fertilised them and added Crispr reagents to alter their genetic structure before implanting the embryos into a surrogate sheep’s uterus.” Three sheep were born that each possessed two copies of the CLN1 gene with the same mutation found in affected humans. They began to show many symptoms of Batten disease, including changes in behaviour and brain size. “The progress of the disease in sheep closely resembled its development in children,” said Wishart. “That was crucial for it showed we had created an accurate model of Batten disease.” Other sheep were engineered to carry only a single copy of the gene. “These are symptomless carriers, like the parents of Batten disease children,” said Wishart. “From these we can breed sheep that have two faulty copies of the CLN1 gene. These will go on to develop a disease like those children, and will be the ones to test our therapies.” Researchers are working on several treatments, including gene therapy in which healthy genes are delivered by viruses to replace mutated versions. Many of these techniques are being developed using cell culture and research on mice and rats. It is a terrible necessity – to reproduce such a condition “These studies are crucial in making basic discoveries,” said Wishart. “But if we do not use these few larger animals in refining those discoveries, all that early work could be wasted. “It is a terrible necessity – to reproduce such a condition. However, we are talking about using maybe only 10 or so animals for this research with the ultimate aim of finding treatments that could add years to the lives of young patients. “Unlike humans, we can study sheep before their outward symptoms develop to gain new understanding of how the disease unfolds. This knowledge will be invaluable.”"

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 02.05 BST Recent Star Wars trailers have been masterpieces of tickling fanboy excitement while steering almost perversely clear of spoilers. That’s certainly true of the latest glimpse of The Rise of Skywalker – the ninth film in the series – which landed online on Monday, having premiered at Disney’s D23 Expo over the weekend. It’s the climactic shot of the new clip that has Twitter fingers twitching. The final moments of the trailer feature Daisy Ridley’s heroic Rey clad in distinctly Sith-like robes and wielding a red lightsaber. This is almost certainly a piece of misdirection from director JJ Abrams – known for loving “mystery box” plots even more than he loves blinding lens flare – rather than a grand heel-turn for the franchise’s new leading lady. But it’s the lightsaber itself that is particularly exciting. It’s a dual-bladed weapon, with Ridley’s character snapping the two parallel halves together to form a double-ended staff akin to the one wielded by Darth Maul in the widely derided prequel The Phantom Menace. Rey’s new weapon – even if it proves to be a temporary addition to her arsenal – is the latest unconventional lightsaber to appear in Star Wars. Kylo Ren’s flickering home-made saber, complete with crossguard, caused a stir when it served as a money shot in the first trailer for The Force Awakens, and has proven to be the villain’s weapon of choice ever since. When the lightsaber was first introduced to audiences in George Lucas’s original movie, it was described by Alec Guinness’s Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi as “an elegant weapon for a more civilised age”, as opposed to the “clumsy and random” blasters used by those not deemed worthy enough to join their slightly odd cult. The Jedi/Sith binary is one bound up in tradition and so the idea of a weapon of pure light – which can connote either good or evil depending on where it sits on the colour spectrum – fits the theme perfectly. From the earliest moments of the Star Wars universe, a clear link has been drawn between lightsabers and the characters wielding them. That link makes the new trilogy’s lightsaber innovations even more interesting. Kylo Ren’s weapon is explicitly tied to the immature, petulant bravado that leads him to regularly trash his surroundings in an adolescent strop. The saber was constructed by Ren himself and is evidently an imperfect creation, with its beam of light filled with static crackle – a hastily assembled tribute to the weapon of his idol and grandfather, Darth Vader. It’s the equivalent of a 90s grunge kid recording a tinny version of Smells Like Teen Spirit and thinking he’s Kurt Cobain. It is also the only lightsaber to feature a crossguard. There is a technical explanation for the innovation, as fans of deep-dive Lucas lore will know: the damaged kyber crystal in the handle of the device would overload the blade if it were not vented through the ancillary beams. However, perhaps the immature Ren – an avatar for fragile masculinity – also just thought it looked cool. So what does Rey’s new lightsaber tell us about her? Intricate fan theories already abound that posit Rey and Kylo Ren as two sides of the same proverbial coin. The idea of “bringing balance to the force” has been a constant theme throughout the series, and it’s that which is symbolised by Rey’s lightsaber – two equal, parallel forces uniting to form something completely balanced, like Thanos’s double-sided weapon in Avengers: Endgame. One explanation for the incongruous clip of Rey channelling her goth side is that it’s some sort of dream sequence. But it would seem bizarre for Abrams and his team to create such an innovative new lightsaber design for the sake of a single throwaway moment. There may be more going on here than meets the eye. Or maybe Disney just wants something new to fill the shelves of toy shops."

Last modified on Sat 3 Aug 2019 23.37 BST Already adored by the hordes of orange-swathed fans who flock to grands prix in Europe, Max Verstappen gave them reason to roar until they were hoarse in Hungary. In claiming the first pole position of his career at the Hungarian Grand Prix he also became the first Dutch driver to claim the top spot in Formula One. It was, moreover, a further statement of his talent and another more than welcome challenge to the Mercedes F1 hegemony. Verstappen did so for Red Bull with a flawless lap of the Hungaroring, although pushed to the limit by the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who is in second place. Lewis Hamilton, also for Mercedes, is third with Charles Leclerc next, heading Sebastian Vettel, in the Ferraris. Pole has been a long time coming for a man who is still deceptively young. Verstappen is only 21 but is in his fifth season in F1. Having become the youngest driver to compete in the sport, and its youngest winner, he was entirely unconcerned that he was only its fourth youngest driver to claim pole. He has matured so much in those five years that, while he was elated with the place, there was also the calm consideration of a driver who knows the real business begins on Sunday. “It’s incredible,” he said. “This was still missing. The car felt good all weekend. I’m very happy about today but there’s still a race to do and that’s the most important.” He has every reason to be confident for the race as well, with two wins from three races and with the Red Bull displaying a remarkable turn of pace around a track which plays to their aerodynamic strengths. Verstappen clearly had the balance and stability required for the frequent direction changes at the Hungaroring and was able to exploit them. He did so with some style. He went quickest on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 14.958sec, almost two tenths clear of both Bottas in second and Hamilton in third. That was a mighty advantage to overcome but, much as Bottas tried, he could make little impression. Indeed Verstappen found even more on his second run. Pushing his Red Bull to the edge, he was on another level on his last lap, when he went almost half a second quicker with 1min 14.572sec. It was superb. Bottas followed him to within a hundredth but could not match him. Hamilton, despite looking strong this weekend, was almost two-tenths back. There were rightly celebrations at Red Bull for their first pole this season and with the engine manufacturer Honda, for whom it is a first pole since Jenson Button took the top spot at Australia in 2006. Hamilton was disappointed in being unable to challenge harder. “The car wasn’t the same as it was in third practice,” he said. “It was a bit of a struggle, just plateaued. It didn’t really get better. But we’re still in the fight, hopefully for the race we’ll have better race pace.” There were smiles, however, at the other end of the pitlane, as Williams turned in their best qualifying of the year. Having finally brought the aero upgrades they have been waiting for to Germany it paid off in Hungary, with George Russell in 16th. It was a superb run and the first time Williams have not been slowest on track in qualifying this year. Optimism that they can move closer to the midfield looks justified. Ferrari had expected to be under the cosh through the slow and medium-speed corners of the Hungaroring but Leclerc did not help their cause. He lost the rear, too hot into the final corner and spun into the wall in Q1, taking minor damage. Remarkably his car was still able to put in good times and he did well to take fourth. The day, however, belonged emphatically to Verstappen, continuing a strong and consistent opening to the season. He is third in the world championship, 63 points behind Hamilton and 21 in front of Vettel and there was optimism there would be more reasons for the Dutch fans to celebrate come Sunday. “We know that, if you can start upfront for the race, it makes it easier to control,” he said. “We have been working really hard to improve the engine in quali to get more out if it. That showed today. We keep improving.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/23/tour-championship-rory-mcilroy-brooks-koepka,"Ewan Murray at East Lake Sat 24 Aug 2019 01.50 BST


Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 08.41 BST Depending on your outlook, it is either perfectly fair that this feels like a typical golf tournament at its halfway juncture or the dumbing down of what should be a marquee environment. Sunday’s winner of the Tour Championship will stroll off with $15m after the PGA Tour simplified the conclusion to both its season and the FedEx Cup; handicapped starts, as afforded to players before a ball was struck at East Lake, haven’t altered the dynamic or impacted on the atmosphere. This cuts both ways, of course. In the perfect defence of the amended format, stellar names lead the pack. Rory McIlroy trailed by three when taking to the 17th tee in round two. The Northern Irishman’s birdie-birdie finish and trouble as encountered by Justin Thomas means McIlroy is now just one back, with Brooks Koepka currently the man to catch at 13 under par. Thomas has tied McIlroy at minus 12. “It’s anybody’s golf tournament,” said Thomas. Not altogether true; but this is wonderfully poised. The machinations of this event are apparent when it is highlighted that McIlroy’s actual on-course score is the joint best in the field alongside Paul Casey. At nine under, Casey is two adrift of fourth placed Xander Schauffele. “It feels totally normal,” said McIlroy. “It feels like a normal Tour Championship. If you play well, you’re in those last groups every day.” McIlroy seemed to benefit from a 90-minute late afternoon rain delay, given he played his subsequent stretch in minus three. Thomas, conversely, was one over for his back nine when producing a 68. “I was sort of stuck in neutral before that,” McIlroy admitted. “Then I made that birdie on the 12th hole, I got going from there, and then a fast finish.” Koepka, golf’s man for the big occasion, naturally commands respect. His three under par 67 felt a little underwhelming given he was at that position by the turn. “I don’t feel 100% but it’s definitely close,” said Koepka, in what will serve as a warning to his fellow competitors. Tommy Fleetwood had marauded through the field when four under par through 10 holes. The Englishman’s scenario would have been even more promising at that juncture but for a missed birdie putt from inside 5ft at the 1st. Worse was to follow for Fleetwood late in his round as he bogeyed the 12th and 13th before taking a double bogey six at the 16th. Given the promise as displayed for so long, Fleetwood understandably cut a disconsolate figure when signing for a 70 which means an aggregate of two under par. Justin Rose’s grip on the FedEx Cup, as won 11 months in the kind of afterthought circumstances the PGA Tour were subsequently desperate to avoid, loosened after a Friday 74. Rose had pocketed $10m in 2018 as the golfing world heralded the Tour Championship victory of Tiger Woods. Dustin Johnson, who has been curiously out of sorts with driver in hand, added a 72 to Thursday’s 73. At five over par, Johnson’s hopes of winning the FedEx Cup for the first time are all but done. Not that he appears in downbeat mood; Johnson covered Koepka’s name as displayed on his parking berth with a copy of one of the nude photos as posed for by the four-time major winner and revealed this week. Koepka saw the funny side, whilst admitting the prank was ruined by the footage of the updated signage spreading across the internet long before he arrived for his late tee time. “I had two hours to laugh about it,” he said. “It’s not really that funny when you get here and the cameras are there.” Chez Reavie was safely ensconced in the clubhouse upon completion of a 64 before the hooter was blown. Reavie revealed his hole-in-one – as delivered at the 9th – was his 21st in competition, which marks a quite incredible feat even for a professional. “I have just aimed it at the hole and got lucky a few times,” shrugged Reavie. The simplicity of this explanation was almost offensive."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 23.52 BST The sweltering temperatures on the tube’s Northern line will soon begin keeping homes in Islington, north London, cosy through the colder months, under a scheme to harness the heat from the underground. By the end of the year the project will pipe heat from the underground into hundreds of homes and businesses that are part of a heating scheme in the borough. The project is one of a growing number of schemes across the UK designed to warm homes using “waste heat” from factories, power plants, rivers and disused mine shafts. The hunt for alternative sources of renewable heat has gained pace after the government’s pledge to ban gas-fired boilers from new-build homes from 2025. The Islington heat network already keeps about 700 homes warm by channelling heat created in the Bunhill Energy Centre, which generates electricity, into local council housing, schools and a leisure centre. The next phase of the project, which is due to be completed in the coming months, will extend the network to a further 450 homes. The tube project could pave the way for district heating schemes across the capital to warm homes with cheap, low carbon heat from underground lines. The Greater London Authority (GLA) estimates there is enough heat wasted in London to meet 38% of the city’s heating demands. Tim Rotheray, director of the Association for Decentralised Energy, said district heating schemes were mushrooming across the UK as a low-cost tool in tackling the climate crisis. “Almost half the energy used in the UK is for heat, and a third of UK emissions are from heating. With the government declaring that we must be carbon-neutral within 30 years we need to find a way to take the carbon out of our heating system,” he said. “The opportunity that has become clear to the decentralised energy community is the idea of capturing waste heat and putting it to use locally.” In urban and industrial settings, waste heat is produced wherever there are cooling systems, thermal power plants or heavy industry. The key to harnessing heat is to use it locally. British Sugar’s factory in Wissington, Norfolk, pipes excess heat produced from cooking syrup into a neighbouring 18-hectare (45-acre) greenhouse used to grow medical cannabis. It also pumps some of its carbon emissions into the greenhouse for the plants to convert to oxygen. An even greater source of heat lies below many of Britain’s towns and cities: in the geothermal energy trapped in water at the bottom of old mines. Stoke-on-Trent is working on a £52m project to tap energy from hot water deposits deep underground. This will heat conventional water before it is pumped through the network to customers. Stoke city council estimates the scheme, which will be operational by the winter of 2020, could cut its carbon emissions by an estimated 12,000 tonnes a year. In Edinburgh, engineers at Ramboll have developed a plan to create a heat network that uses the water pooled in a vast disused mine as a giant underground thermal battery. Paul Steen, who has proposed the project, believes the mine water offers “massive potential” to help the city meet its sustainability goals by connecting it to a renewable heating and cooling distribution system. The flooded mine system lies up to 500 metres (1,640ft) below ground, and measures 8km (5 miles) in length by 6km wide. During the summer heat produced by cooling systems and heavy industry could be pumped down into the aquifer where it will slowly raise the temperature of the water. During the winter, the mine water would be pumped to the surface and “low grade” heat will be extracted in a heat exchanger. The water could then be pumped through a heat pump for heating homes and businesses. Engineers in Glasgow have even found heat potential in the River Clyde. The city’s £250m Queen’s Quay regeneration project will host a project that uses heat pumps to extract heat from the river water before piping it into a 2.5km-long network that includes 1,400 homes, businesses and public buildings. It should provide a warm welcome to the 30,000 delegates due to attend the UN climate talks in Glasgow next year. "
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/11/indoor-plant-sales-boom-reflecting-urbanisation-and-design-trends,"Millennials’ desire to nurture and care for something also contribute to rise Sarah Marsh Sun 11 Aug 2019 16.07 BST


Last modified on Sun 11 Aug 2019 21.12 BST Indoor plants sales are booming as a result of urbanisation, interior design trends and millennials’ desire to have something to nurture and care for. According to experts, the rise in sales of indoor plants and plant accessories, as well as the prominence of Instagram influencers – social media personalities with tens of thousands of followers – speaks to a growing trend among young people. When George Hudson, 24, moved to London from Derbyshire to start a politics degree, he missed the green spaces he had grown up in. He started work in Walworth Garden, which let him reconnect with nature; from there, his fascination with house plants grew and he now owns about a dozen. “It’s partly a back-to-nature thing, a relief from the developed cities we live in,” he said. “It also gives people something to look after and care for; something people crave. There is a bit of a collector’s addiction about it.” The online furniture store Made.com said sales of plant accessories had quadrupled this year. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has also reported a 10-15% year-on-year increase across the industry in houseplants since 2013. RHS retail reported a houseplant sales growth of 50% in 2018, driven largely by foliage plant sales which have doubled. Online plant store Patch said 67% of Londoners bought a houseplant in the last 12 months, according to its research. There was a 10% rise in plant purchasing for 25- to 34-year-olds. The store sold 130,000 plants in 2018 and is on track to sell 300,000 in 2019. Freddie Blackett, Patch’s founder, said it was hard to pin a date on when the trend started. “Urbanisation is a big driver,” he said. “People are increasingly living in tight spaces in increasingly tight cities so access to nature is much reduced.” Blackett said the physical and mental health benefits of plants were also a draw as indoor plants help clean the air and are said to ease depression and anxiety. Another change had been design trends, he said. “We have seen people move away from stark minimalism.” Ali Edwards, the design manager at Made.com, said there had been a big trend for wellness within the home. “We’ve seen a rise in popularity of calming furnishings like woven rattans and spherical lighting,” she said. Alice Vincent, an author and journalist who runs an Instagram account with thousands of followers dedicated to plants, said there was something more meaningful going on for younger people. “Millennials don’t have the housing and security our parents had. We grow up slower and that does not mean we don’t want to connect, have something to nurture,” she said. Vincent noted that house plants had gone in and out of favour for decades. “In the Victorian era, they were very fascinated with them … Fast forward again and in the 1970s there was a huge proliferation in house plants. We are taking up the mantle again and you see it reflected in the fact everyone likes mid-century stylings, and interiors … and so plants are part and parcel with that.” Jamie Song, whose Instagram account Jamie’s Jungle has 201,000 followers, described the growth as an “explosion”. “As urban dwellers, we live, commute and work with such limited access to green space that nature affords others. Having greenery in your living space can provide you with that connection with the earth and nature and can be your daily reminder of the importance of protecting our environment. From a decor standpoint, indoor plants can be an affordable choice to fill your living space,” he said.“I have more than 200,000 followers and I would suppose based upon my observations that over 70% were millennials. Millennials have grown up in a world that is changing dramatically. Climate change, technology, social media are all part of the rapid changes particularly affecting the newer generation. I believe millennials feel like they’ve inherited a world that is much worse off than for previous generations. House plants have provided millennials therefore, a refuge from the stresses caused by those things that have reshaped our world.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/10/a-tale-of-two-cities-new-york-style-meets-london-chic,"Art is given centre stage in a designer’s bright monochrome apartment by  Kate Jacobs Sat 10 Aug 2019 15.00 BST Carl Blücher sits in his trademark baseball cap and eye-poppingly bright trainers, his friendly miniature dachshund, Mr Big, on his knee in his New-York-loft-inspired east London flat. When the new Whistles creative project manager bought the compact flat in an Edwardian mansion block 13 years ago, the original dining room was being used as a third bedroom and the kitchen was tucked away at the back. “It felt very small, dark and boxy,” says Blücher, “but I could see that the proportions of the rooms were good.” He lived here for a couple of years, making only cosmetic changes before moving and renting the place out to friends. “But all the time I was away, I kept thinking about this flat and how best to make it work.” Three years ago, he and his French boyfriend Ben, who works in fashion marketing, decided to return. “I’ve always loved Lower Clapton. It’s really diverse with a brilliant sense of community – but now it has good restaurants, too.” Houses seem safe and provincial to me. I always wanted to live in a flat Blücher is particularly happy about living in a flat. “Maybe it was growing up in Sweden, but houses seem safe and provincial to me. I always wanted to live in a flat. It’s that New York loft idea – apartments seem more cool.” The mansion block’s dual function, utilitarian heritage – it was in fact designed with shops at ground level and flats above for the shopkeepers – added to its appeal. Blücher set about giving this little place some Big Apple character, starting with the front bedroom, which he turned back into a dining room, knocking it through to the living room to create a bright, pleasingly proportioned space. “We thought about getting rid of two bedrooms, so losing one didn’t seem so dramatic after that,” he explains. “I like the idea of openness but not literal one-room living.” The flat is two rooms wide and three rooms deep, and originally had a corridor snaking in between, says Blücher, who came to London in 2001 and studied product design at Camberwell College of Art, then Central Saint Martins. For a decade, he oversaw the creative direction of Islington design store Aria, where he championed collaborations between artists and designers including graphic artist Camille Walala, which saw her Memphis-inspired designs featuring on furniture and home accessories. Now he’s excited about his new creative role at Whistles. “It’s a big fashion brand but it feels exciting, like an independent.” His masterstroke was to swap the dark central bedroom with the little kitchen at the back of the flat, built back when kitchens were purely functional rather than recreational spaces, and measuring 100 sq ft. He then took down the walls of the central room, opening it up into the wraparound corridor, effectively doubling the space and lightening it up in the process. “It creates a better atmosphere when you come straight into the kitchen rather than a cramped corridor. It’s the heart of the home now,” says Blücher. He decided to go for a period look in the kitchen, with its Shaker-esque panelled cabinets, marble worktops, range cooker and metro tiles, as a nod to the Edwardian building. He chose a central kitchen island with a butcher’s block-inspired wooden top. “We eat breakfast here and it’s a great place to congregate at parties.” Elsewhere in the flat, Blücher’s art collection was the starting point for the decor. “I keep the furniture pared back and simple, with a slightly 60s Scandinavian vibe because I don’t want it to compete for attention with the art.” Blücher is attracted to edgy, graphic pieces, often with a humorous element, such as his David Shrigley drawing, for which he customised a traditional gilded frame with neon light tubing. “I also like to buy works by new artists, often from graduation shows. I really like to get to know the artist and many become friends.” To create a cohesive feel, a black and white theme runs through many of the pieces. “Monochrome is quite a timeless look that transcends trends, and it feels right for the city.” Painting the whole flat white and dressing the windows overlooking the traffic-heavy street with opaque white blinds was, he says, an obvious move to maximise the natural light. The atmosphere manages to be both tranquil and stimulating, ultimately adapting to what’s happening in the flat: “It works well whether I’m working or seeking some calm, whether we’ve got a crowd round for dinner or are just relaxing here with Mr Big.” A mix of midcentury-inspired modern furniture and antiques, typically 18th- and 19th-century pieces from candelabra to gilt-framed paintings bought in the UK or on trips to France and Sweden, bring depth and texture to this modern space. “They bring their own history to the room,” says Blucher. “I grew up in an eclectic home that was full of memories of our family’s travels – and now I’m building that for myself.”"

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 10.14 BST Can you imagine a world in which humans are allergic to each other? Not just in the current sense (getting furiously annoyed on social media, say) but physically being unable to come into any kind of contact with another person because to do so might kill you? It’s actually a tough ask. Liam Brown has had a valiant effort at doing the work for us – but as his novel Skin demonstrates, doing anything at all under such circumstances other than staying at home or dying immediately, becomes highly convoluted. Initially, that complexity is part of the novel’s appeal. Brown has fun describing a world in which his characters live in quarantine, communicating via computer screens. People have even less idea about what is real and what is Photoshop than we do, because they have no chance of getting outside to see for themselves. Brown’s post-apocalyptic nightmare is a fun way of exploring ideas about atomisation and the corrupting influence of social media. Those few who do get to go outside have to dress up in protective suits, go through complicated decontamination routines, walk along prescribed and very short routes for limited amounts of time and with specific purposes. Brown’s narrator, Angela, is lucky enough to get a job surveilling a small bit of ground near her home as part of a “neighbourhood watch” scheme. But her life is claustrophobic and limited; small wonder that the government issues a cocktail of antidepressant medications alongside the vacuum-packed food parcels they despatch to survivors. But it’s also here that the premise begins to break down. There seems to be a functioning industrial complex out in this post-apocalyptic world – but no one in the main narrative is either able or allowed to leave the house for any amount of time. So: who is wrapping up the food? Who is growing it? Can it all be done by robots? And if it is, who built the robots? I was similarly confused about how the government was operating. We’re given some vague answers in a series of flashbacks about the initial outbreak of the unspecified virus that has made skin-to-skin contact lethal. Angela and her family survived while trigger-happy soldiers restored a kind of order. But Brown, perhaps wisely, doesn’t give many details about how some people are able to be out policing the streets, raiding homes and applying the law very physically when everyone else is stuck inside. Also: if it was a virus, and everyone either died or retreated into quarantine, why didn’t the virus just die out? This idea is briefly broached late on in the narrative, where it comes as a kind of revelation to Angela – but surely this is one of the things everyone would be considering? But if you can keep such questions down and suspend your disbelief long enough, there are rewards to be had in Skin. Brown’s prose is light and clear and always highly readable. I began to feel real sympathy both for Angela and her teenage daughter, Amber, who has to grow up simultaneously in isolation and with her whole emotional life smeared across social media. But more and more problems also began to crop up. Angela meets someone who is able to wander around outside without any kind of suit on. “If he did turn out to be immune, the government would be able to use him as a vaccine,” she thinks. But then she just kind of shrugs. “I kept Jazz all to myself. I guess, if I’m honest, I felt possessive of him.” And we don’t get much more than that. No matter that she could have saved her family, herself and her world. In the absence of plausible reasoning, we can only assume that the real reason she didn’t turn Jazz in is that Brown didn’t want to end the book on page 50. It’s almost a shame that he didn’t cut things short, because as Skin goes on, the implausibilities turn into absurdities, then tip over into inadvertent comedy. One climactic scene has Angela fleeing from her husband’s virtual reality schlong and we have to deal with this description: “As long and thick as my arm, it twitched menacingly in my direction, its tip glistening with a foul-looking fluid.” Yikes! It’s the most evil penis since Zardoz, and it isn’t even the daftest thing in the final chapters. But at least such silliness is entertaining. I may have lost faith in the book but I was never bored. If you’re looking for entertainment, you could do far worse. Next time: Please Read This Leaflet Carefully by Karen Havelin"
https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/aug/12/not-the-booker-prize-2019-three-more-finalists-revealed,"After the public vote last week, our judges and book champions reveal their choices to complete the six-novel field. Let’s start reading! Sam Jordison Mon 12 Aug 2019 13.36 BST


Last modified on Wed 21 Aug 2019 12.57 BST We now have a full size Not the Booker prize shortlist. Following on from the public vote, our judges from last year have selected Spring by Ali Smith, while our nominated book champions from Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh have chosen Flames by Robbie Arnott and Supper Club by Lara Williams respectively. I’m eager to read these new additions – not least because I’ve read what our expert team of selectors have to say about them. Caroline Dunseath, librarian at Storyhouse, says of Flames: It interweaves the story of the McAllister family with a cast of characters including a grumpy coffin-maker, a fisherman who hunts with a seal, a river god, an alcoholic private detective and an increasingly unhinged wombat farmer. Each of these characters has a very different voice and style, and Arnott is unafraid to experiment with different narrative forms … the way these seemingly disparate characters interact with each other is deftly done and the ending had me in tears. This book has been nominated for Australian literary prizes but definitely deserves a wider readership in other countries. I’m taking that last sentence as a hint. Meanwhile, Julie Danskin, the manager at Golden Hare Books has this to say about its nominee: Our selection caused a lot of discussion but, in the end, we went with the brilliant debut Supper Club. A powerfully visceral read, it tells the story of a secret society of women hungry for more than the awful men in their lives can ever give them. Determined to be more than their lot, they quaff, sing and dance until their bodies grow huge from their defiance. Truly brilliant dark fiction with a cover to die for. We also had the pleasure of hosting Lara for the launch for Supper Club, and can vouch she is as excellent a human as she is a writer. We’re really excited about this new talent and we hope she wins! Finally, our three judges from last year’s prize united behind Spring by Ali Smith. Graham Fulcher says: Spring is the third of Ali Smith’s seasonal quartet, a highlight of each literary year with their rhythmic examination of contemporaneous events through wordplay, historical resonance, female artists who capture past decades (here Katherine Mansfield and the 1920s), Dickens, Charlie Chaplin and Shakespeare’s late romances (here Pericles). [Read his full review on Goodreads here.] Cath Barton adds: Spring is, to me, a profoundly affecting book: about ways of seeing, ways of knowing, ways of understanding, ways of loving. The book’s coincidences, in the words of one of the characters in the book, are of the kind “that sends electricity through the truths of our lives.” And Eleanor Hayworth writes: Spring is a timely and powerful novel which touches on the crises of our contemporary world while maintaining a strong core of humanity and a dash of humour. In delivering these eloquent opinions, those judges have completed their final duty. That means we are once again on the lookout for three expert reviewers for this year. One of them could be you. This is your big chance to influence the way things shape up over the next few weeks – and next year, too. To be a judge, all you need to do is follow the guidance of our good and righteous terms and conditions: 12. Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is also left studiously vague and at the Guardian’s discretion. These judges undertake to read at least three of the six-book shortlist before the final judging meeting. That final meeting is crucial to the outcome, but our judges do far more than simply help decide on the winner. Because they join in the discussions throughout the process, they help us do the really important work of discovering what matters about our shortlisted books. They also often provide a useful counter to my own opinions – and help ensure that other voices are heard throughout the process. If you want to get a sense of what it is like, you can watch last year’s judging meeting online – and I hope that you’ll want to join that impressive roster this year. Talking of impressive rosters, here is our final shortlist: Flames by Robbie Arnott (Atlantic) Skin by Liam Brown (Legend) The Unauthorised Biography Of Ezra Maas by Daniel James (Dead Ink) Please Read This Leaflet Carefully by Karen Havelin (Dead Ink) Spring by Ali Smith (Hamish Hamilton) Supper Club by Lara Williams (Hamish Hamilton) We now have six new books to explore. I’ll be reading and reviewing them in alphabetical order by author surname at the rate of roughly one a week, starting with Flames by Robbie Arnott next Monday. If I were a stronger person, I’d have been able to avoid all comments about the competition hotting up. Let’s just say I’m burning to get reading."

I actually used to hate techno; would rather die than listen to it, until I was sober for a year. It seems somewhat paradoxical to give up booze and suddenly start hanging out on vodka-sticky dancefloors. But, just like an SSRI, mix a high BPM into my bloodstream and my mood will lift. There’s a physical element to techno that is lacking in other genres. There is, of course, joy to be found in sliding across one’s kitchen floor in socks, bellowing out pop lyrics into the handle of a broom; but just as the physicality of exercise takes one out of the mind, so does the bodily response to the thud, thud, thud of techno. The rattling of the ribcage; the beat of the music in your chest – as if you had the world’s most muscular, obnoxious heart. There’s no space for bad thoughts, doubt or worry when the senses are assailed. Last weekend I felt awful. I spent the entirety of Saturday in a duvet-cave. The banality of life, the relentlessness. Boris Johnson. On Sunday, I dragged myself from bed, threw some stuff in a bag and set off to Wilderness festival. A couple of years before I had been revived, Lazarus by way of lasers, dancing at 2am in the festival’s Valley – a literal valley – green beams scanning the night sky, pushing through trees in the black. Again, this is not something I envisioned a few years ago: I’m a huge Girls Aloud fan. But from that valley full of noise, I progressed to the thump of industrial techno at the infamous Berghain in Berlin. The sweaty basements of east London or repurposed gasholders. Wilderness worked again this year. (I did the wild swimming, too.) They say routine is good for mental health, and techno is nothing if not routine. A 10-minute techno track is the embodiment of keeping going. And there are barely any lyrics to drag the mind to places it isn’t helpful to go. A bonus is that techno often takes place in the kind of Brutalist spaces or decrepit warehouses that also sing to my soul, but it can be equally helpful throwing my hood up, earpods in, and walking around at night listening to a playlist that smacks as my heels hit the pavement. Try it."

https://www.theguardian.com/tech-that-empowers-everyone/2019/jul/03/when-chase-is-on-his-computer-he-feels-like-any-other-nine-year-old,"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsy by Eimear O'Hagan It’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration. Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent. On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him. “Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected. “The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling. “When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.” Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite. After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour. “The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki. “He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.” While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves. “He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence. “I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.” A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console. ‘Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa’; (above) Chase uses the OSK, powered by Windows 10, on his HP 14” Silver laptop “We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.” Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists. “It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.” Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis & Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 16.05 BST This show is billed as “brutally honest” so let’s be brutally honest. Mel B’s audience isn’t full – although neither is it the sales disaster that supports tabloid speculation that two spoken-word performances will lose her £57,000. She also denies press reports that she is “unemployed and broke”. However, there’s certainly a story in how working-class teenager Melanie Brown became a Spice Girls superstar and is now a 44-year old mother back home in Leeds, living with her mum. Grilled on a union jack sofa by “celebrity journalist”/biographer Louise Gannon, Brown reveals the five hours of hair-weaving and vocal warm-ups that turn her into Scary Spice. She talks about her mixed-race childhood and bisexuality, hints that the Spice Girls will play Glastonbury in 2020 and is joined by her dog, Cookie, who promptly pees on stage. Things turn from surreal to compelling when Brown discusses her 10-year marriage, which she claims was “coercive, abusive and violent”. (Her former husband, Stephen Belafonte, disputes her allegations.) She is incisive on the incremental power of a controlling man and talks about why she had a tattoo of her ex-husband’s name physically cut from her body (she keeps it in a jar). Her tearful video diaries from the marriage are harrowing. A woman gets up from the audience to thank Brown for championing LGBT rights and proposes to her girlfriend on stage, and we haven’t even reached the interval yet. Second-half subjects career from suicide attempts to how her father’s death gave her the push to finally leave Belafonte. She discusses her televised claim to Piers Morgan that she once had sex with Geri Horner (which Ginger Spice denies), explains why she bought a goat and howls: “Stop stealing my show!” at Cookie, who is dancing on hind legs. The show ends with Brown bickering comically with “Mother” (“What’s this about us buying chickens?”) and dancing with her family to I Will Survive. It’s far too long, but somewhere in the chaos is a powerful insight into superstardom’s human cost and what it means to gain, surrender and determinedly rediscover girl power. • At the Savoy theatre, London, on 1 September.

Edward Siddons Thu 15 Aug 2019 08.00 BST


Last modified on Thu 15 Aug 2019 11.07 BST I took this shot in 1995 in my home studio in Highbury Hill, London. At that point, I was in a liminal state with my gender: I was moving from being perceived as female to being perceived as male, but really I was coming to terms with the fact I was born intersex. I was not transitioning. I had no interest in moving from one fixed point to another. The spaces in-between have always been so much more interesting to me. But this period felt like a turning point in my uncovering the ambiguity in my gender that had always been there. I felt it needed documenting. For my whole life, I was terrified of not being perceived as adequately feminine, both by straight people and by the lesbian community I was a part of. Because of that fear, I had plucked out the hairs sprouting on my chin – I literally pulled them out with tweezers as soon as they were visible. But I had entered a competition for Drag Kings at the National Film Theatre, and my partner at the time was more into my masculinity than my femininity, so it felt like the right time to come to accept my body. I went to Italy for a month, and let my beard grow out for the very first time. It was intensely liberating. It felt like coming to terms with myself. When I came back to London I kept it. This photo matters to me because it’s ambiguous: I’m sporting the beard, and playing with masculinity in my pose, but the blue mascara in my facial hair and makeup on my face still softens the shot. It felt accurate and honest, in terms of where I was at that period of my life. Self-portraiture is central to my work: it is a way of me understanding, responding to and coming to terms with my difference. I was born with an intersex variation, and when puberty hit I developed asymmetrically: one breast was much larger than the other, for example. I have been photographed and filmed a lot – and much of it presents an image of me that I find devastating For years I hid it. I hid what made me different, and I dealt with years of abuse for looking different, for being a little fat, for not conforming. My mother was gorgeous — fashion-model beautiful — and I didn’t take after her. I destroyed almost every picture that survives of me from those years because I felt disgusting. Self-portraiture was a way of letting other people see me as I see myself. It was never a narcissistic project – I was never interested in being more beautiful or more attractive than other people – but it was an attempt to recuperate a sense of self and worth after years of that being taken away from me. I have been photographed and filmed a lot during my life, and much of it presents an image of me that I find absolutely devastating. Self-portraiture was me taking a stand, both for myself and people like me who differ from the norm. Because, while I am the subject of much of my work, it isn’t purely about me. When people talk about the self-portraiture or confessional writing, there’s often a pejorative edge to it, as though you’re being self-indulgent or as if there’s something wrong with it. But I think the real question is why you make yourself the subject of your art, and what your goal is. Is it to receive absolution? I don’t need that. Is it to receive attention? Because I already get plenty. For me, I’m presenting myself in the hope that others like me will understand that their difference is valuable, that they can be out and proud and unapologetic, that they do not have to conform. Self-portraiture has been popular among women and queer people and minorities throughout time, from Claude Cahun last century to Zanele Muholi today. I think for us, and for me, it’s because we realise that the personal is political. This is our form of resistance. There’s now an interest in queer photography and queer photographers. I don’t know how deep that is, or how long it will last. When the year ends and we no longer have the 50th anniversary of Stonewall as a news hook, will the media still make space for us? Will galleries still show our work? Will audiences who aren’t queer still care? Watch this space. • Del LaGrace Volcano’s work can be seen at Kiss My Genders at the Hayward Gallery, London, until 8 September. Born: Orange, California, 1957.

https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/21/bauhaus-100-review-a-celebration-of-an-art-school-that-was-truly-radical,"From tracing its post-war roots to putting today’s artists to the test, BBC Four’s night at the Bauhaus was illuminating and fun Lucy Mangan Wed 21 Aug 2019 23.00 BST To mark the centenary of the endlessly influential art school’s foundation by Walter Gropius, BBC Four spent a night in the Bauhaus. It began with a half-hour trot through the life and pioneering artwork of Anni Albers, in A Life in Thread. From her banishment to the weaving workshop (where female students were expected to go instead of metalwork or other departments – progressive institutions always have surprisingly traditional limitations) we witnessed her transformation of the ancient craft into unique art and a lauded career. Then we had an hour of Bauhaus at 100, tracing its roots as a reaction against expressionism and a bid to put the pieces of a shattered postwar world back together in a new and better way. Whether it worked is an open question. The school was effectively shut down by the increasingly powerful Nazi regime in 1933 and the programme was bookended by a discussion about the controversial decision to cancel a recent event at the Bauhaus building (now a Unesco heritage site) after far-right activists threatened to disrupt it. But, as one of the contributors noted, no experiment in creativity can ever really be said to have failed. Let alone one in whose influence we are still steeped today, with whose designs – both typographical and architectural – we still live, even if we have not kept hold of the idealistic message the marriage of form and function was intended to convey. After all that edutainment, you might have felt ready for a bit of fun. Along came Bauhaus Rules, presented by “Jim Moir, AKA Vic Reeves” – as he was billed in the credits – to provide. The unashamed gimmick here was to take a handful of art students and give them a different Bauhaus-based task, overseen by a different artist, every day for a week and see how they took to the school rules. Ian Whittlesea did the breathing exercises that Johannes Itten, who developed the Bauhaus “preliminary course” that still forms the basis for all art foundation courses, believed helped expand the self-awareness vital for artists. If you find yourself bursting with opinions about the self-awareness of artists, see me after class. They take such things seriously here, even while munching on the garlic mush Itten insisted students eat as part of his commitment to Mazdaznan (a fire cult; don’t worry about it). Then they had to make some art out of contrasting materials. Whittlesea’s response to one piece – “So little evident work” – was the most beautifully constructed thing of all. It was fun – a neat way of giving life to the beliefs and theories that animated the Bauhaus founders and, at times, even providing a glimpse into varying artistic temperaments. On the day, Kandinsky’s correspondence theory got a run-out (this is the theory that all circles are essentially blue, triangles yellow and squares red, and you can go and eat more garlic mush if you prefer); some thrived on the rigidity of it, while others … did not. “I don’t agree with it,” said Amar, while Lizzy reckoned: “I trust myself more than Kandinksy.” Oh, to be young and confident again. It also returned to points raised by the earlier programmes. When the students were tasked by Kate Butler, the head of product design at Habitat, with producing a (useful, beautiful) domestic item, we learned that as well as discouraging women from metalwork, the Bauhaus founders believed women could not think in 3D. Marianne Brandt insisted on doing both, eventually succeeding the metalshop master László Moholy-Nagy and producing iconic modern industrial works still revered and imitated today. She must have been quite the headscratcher (and surely worth a half-hour to herself). Also noted was Itten’s transformation from spiritually alert artist into man with a hard-on for eugenics and no issue with the seam of Aryanism that ran through his chosen cult, which went unmentioned in the formal documentary. Overall it was a night that conveyed the wonderment that attends the invention of something genuinely radical and new. Because it has shaped our world so thoroughly over the last 100 years, the awe at the achievement – at any such widely adopted achievement – needs to be periodically disinterred and felt anew. So little evident work, it seems now. Yet this gave back the notion that it wasn’t little work at all. It was a vision of a better world, expressed through all forms of art. How amazing. And how surpassingly impossible it seems now."
https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/tottenham-uncertain-christian-eriksen-intentions,"• Eriksen is thought to covet Real Madrid or Barcelona move• Injuries force Pochettino to consider makeshift right-back David Hytner Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.11 BST


First published on Tue 27 Aug 2019 19.00 BST Tottenham are in the dark over Christian Eriksen’s intentions regarding the next move of his career because of a breakdown in the relationship between Daniel Levy and the midfielder’s agent. There have been no talks for some time between Levy, Tottenham’s chairman, and Martin Schoots, who represents Eriksen, and it has served to heighten the uncertainty and vulnerability that the club feel over one of their star players – and that Mauricio Pochettino has referenced on more than one occasion. Eriksen has entered the final year on his contract, he has shown no inclination to sign a new one and Spurs believe he has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona. Whether either club bids for him before next Monday’s transfer deadline in Spain remains to be seen. It is more likely that they would prefer to wait until next summer when Eriksen would be available for nothing but, given that Spurs do not have a clear handle on what is in the works for Eriksen, it promises to be an anxious week or so for them. Pochettino, who has started Eriksen in only one of Spurs’ three games this season, said after Sunday’s home defeat against Newcastle that he had not known a more unsettling start to a campaign at the club – and Eriksen’s situation has been a major contributing factor. Spurs have spent £59.9m on players this summer but they hope to recoup around £10m with the sale of the midfielder Victor Wanyama to Club Brugge. They are also open to offers for the right-back Serge Aurier, who is in danger of becoming the club’s forgotten man. Aurier, signed from Paris Saint-Germain for £23m in 2017, has played only one game since February and he is unlikely to be considered for Sunday’s derby at Arsenal, despite Pochettino’s options at right-back being limited. Kyle Walker-Peters is set to miss out with the hamstring injury that forced him off against Newcastle and Juan Foyth is unavailable with an ankle problem. Pochettino is expected to turn to a makeshift right-back – either Moussa Sissoko, who filled the position during the latter stages of the Newcastle game, or Eric Dier."

Last modified on Thu 1 Aug 2019 06.34 BST This weekend the best Fortnite players in the world gathered at Flushing Meadows in New York to compete in the game’s first ever World Cup Finals for $30m (£24m) in prize money. Tens of thousands of spectators packed the famed Arthur Ashe stadium to watch the action live, and many millions more viewed on Twitch and YouTube. Fortnite is, after all, one of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet, played by hundreds of millions. Amid all the hype and fanfare around the finals, however, one depressing fact remained unavoidable: not a single one of the 100 finalists was female. Despite the growing popularity of professional gaming throughout the world – the audience figures for competitive gaming have reached 450m this year – female competitors remain scarce. There certainly are high-profile examples of female pros – trans woman Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn is one of the most successful Starcraft II players in the world; Katherine “Mystik” Gunn is the industry’s highest-paid female pro gamer and won the SyFy channel’s reality TV show WCG Ultimate Gamer; and Fortnite has stars such as One_Shot_Gurl and Loeya. But you could watch a year of big tournaments, whether it’s Call of Duty, League of Legends or Hearthstone, and count the number of female competitors on the fingers of one hand. If things are to improve, the onus is on the game publishers, event organisers, big-name sponsors and team owners This isn’t because women and girls aren’t playing games. The latest figures from the Entertainment Software Association show that 46% of gamers are women – a figure reflected in several other recent studies. The female audience for esports is also growing: figures collected by Nielsen suggest that almost a quarter of the pro gaming audience is female, and in some parts of the world it’s much higher. So why aren’t we seeing that reflected in the Fortnite World Cup? The easy answer is because no women qualified. The heats were entirely open and held online over 10 weeks – more than 40m players competed with no restrictions on age or gender. The pro gaming scene likes to present itself as a meritocracy, where pure talent is all that matters. This may be true in terms of the abstract qualifying rules, but the real issue goes deeper and its about why women are under-represented across the esports spectrum. In short, it's a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a flying bus on to a small island and then fight until only one is left. Hidden around are weapons and traps, and players must arm themselves while exploring. Fortnite started in July 2017 as a four-player cooperative survival game, but the game's developer, Epic, noticed the huge success of PC title PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which pits 100 players against each other, and decided to release a new version. The game is free and players are able to unlock new items as they progress without paying anything. A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items. It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones. Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements – nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers – into one package that is free to download. Partly it’s down to the culture of “hardcore” video game communities, which are overwhelmingly dominated by young men and as a consequence, often unwelcoming to women. Trash talk is a standard in most online competitive games, and can often cross over into misogynistic insults. Rare is the female gamer who plays with unrestricted voice chat. Even when they’re simply playing online with a group of strangers, women players are sometimes belittled and objectified, their abilities constantly questioned. Meanwhile, the sponsorship and marketing of events is highly focused on male viewers – it’s all energy drinks and ads for ridiculously macho gaming joypads, keyboards and mice with names like Viper and Hyperion. When women do compete, they can find themselves under disproportionate and unwelcome scrutiny. In June, a 15-year-old girl entered a tournament in New York based around the Nintendo game Super Smash Bros and promptly beat a top pro player. She was subsequently hounded and bullied online by his fans. Tweeting under her gaming tag, Bocchi, she claimed to be considering leaving the tournament circuit because of the abuse she received. you won't be able to find me as bocchi. I'm sorry to everyone who looks up to me and likes me but i can't do this anymore. All this stress, all this torture just because people like me and its a game. Im sorry. Goodbye. This is a longstanding problem: in 2016, when the BBC interviewed pro gamer Steph Harvey for its 100 Women series, she stated: “It’s still a ‘boys’ club’ so as a woman you’re automatically judged for being different. The way I get harassed is about what they would do to my body, about why I don’t deserve to be there because I use my sexuality – it’s all extremely graphic.” Earlier this year, Susie Kim, then manager of the London Spitfires team of professional Overwatch players, was asked by the Associated Press if women were good enough to play at the highest levels. “Absolutely,” she said. “But they’re just like, ‘It’s a headache. I don’t want to be part of this at all.’ I don’t blame them.” Even women who make it into well-known professional esports teams are subject to abuse and belittlement. In June, streamer and pro player Lunarkats, who creates content for the Lazurus team, tweeted a video of her playing Counter Strike Global Offensive online and receiving sexualised abuse from her own team-mates. ""lunar will suck you"" ""are you gay? maybe he's just gay"" ""he or she or it? do you have a dick or vagina?"" ""maybe its gender fluid"" ""i would rather be dead than be a girl"" ""see you on Reddit...top page stop girl harassment haha""pugs are amazing pic.twitter.com/UoRXDD55jr In some ways, the lack of female pro players also reflects an imbalance in traditional sports. Most surveys show that teenage girls drop out of competitive sports at 1.5 to two times the rate of boys, with the Women’s Sports Foundation citing a variety of causes, including fewer opportunities, safety issues, social stigma and lack of positive role models, and in esports the same factors are at play. One solution has been to set up female-only leagues and competitions, allowing young women players a less toxic environment in which to hone their skills and compete. However, this has proved controversial, with some seeing sex-based partitioning as a means of sidelining and undervaluing women players: unlike in traditional sports, there are no physical differences at play to justify gender segregation. There is a lingering belief that young men are simply better at games than women, and though there is little detailed research in this area (a study in 2016 from the University of California found that gender had little or no relevance in terms of ability in a range of fantasy role-playing games), the sociocultural barriers, online gatekeeping and suspicion with which female competitors are greeted are the more obvious barriers to their greater success right now. If things are to improve, the onus is on the game publishers, event organisers, big-name sponsors and team owners to attract and employ more female gamers, to challenge the sometimes sexist culture of the competitive gaming scene through better moderation and stiffer penalties for abuse (for pros as well as amateurs), and to pay well-known female players the same as their male counterparts. Fortnite is in a good position to attract more female professionals. It already has a much larger female audience than most online shooters, with Epic estimating that women make up 35% of the game’s user base, perhaps because it’s a much brighter, funnier and more friendly game than other highly militarised online shooters and it’s free and available on smartphones, which has made it more accessible. Epic has also endeavoured to attract and support female streamers and pro-players, inviting several high-profile YouTube and Twitch stars such as One_Shot_Gurl, Alexia Raye, LoserFruit and Ewok to take place in the pro-celebrity matches that proceeded the World Cup games. Though esports revenues are set to hit $1bn this year, it remains a young and immature industry. Working out best practices in terms of encouraging gender diversity is a challenge that will affect every publisher and event organiser in the world over the coming years if growth is to be maintained – even for the creators of the biggest entertainment franchise on the planet. One of the most moving moments of the Fortnite World Cup weekend was when the major esports team Faze Clan introduced its newest signing and first ever female player, Ewok, to the rest of the squad, leading to raucous celebrations. As esports get bigger and bigger, it would be a tragic waste to replicate the institutional biases affecting traditional sport, where women are both represented less and paid less. Gaming is supposed to be a modern, forward-looking industry and esports is an exciting sector that’s rocketing in popularity and influence – now is the time to act. • Keith Stuart is an author and journalist"
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/ash-barty-bounces-back-to-win-first-round-at-us-open,"Australian Associated Press Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.44 BST


Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.45 BST Ashleigh Barty breathed a big sigh of relief after surviving a scare and progressing to the second round of the US Open in New York. Australia’s world No.2 had to pull out all the stops before battling past dogged Kazakh Zarina Diyas 1-6 6-3 6-2 on day one. Barty used her trusty trademark serve to drag herself out of a deep hole and set up a date on Wednesday with unseeded American Lauren Davis. “I just had to start with my serve,” the French Open champion said after finishing with eight aces in the three-set escape. “I really wasn’t giving myself enough chances on serve. I don’t know what the percentage was in the first set ... but it wasn’t good.” Opening tournament proceedings on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Barty made a terrible start, falling behind 5-0 in 20 minutes after struggling to find her rhythm. After 19 unforced errors, Australia’s big title hope found herself down a set inside half an hour. A furious Barty emerged a different player in the second set, bludgeoning a succession of winners to work her way back into the contest. It took her eight games, though, to break down Diyas, ranked 77th in the world. But once she did Barty sealed the second set with a signature ace down the middle to get back on level terms. She gained two more breaks in the third set to advance after a tough one-hour, 42-minute work-out. “Zarina was able to put it in difficult positions even off my slice,” Barty said. “It was about trying to do it regularly and put her under pressure.” Despite the shaky start, the 23-year-old said it was a thrill to return to Arthur Ashe Stadium following her breakthrough doubles triumph last year with CoCo Vandeweghe. “It was a bit bizarre. We walked out here on practice the other day and some good memories came floating back,” Barty said. “We are really pleased with the way we were able to solve this riddle today, figure it out and progress to the second round.” Alex de Minaur also moved into the second round with a 6-4 6-2 6-7 (6-8) 7-5 win over Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in four sets. But fellow Australians Samantha Stosur, Daria Gavrilova and Priscilla Hon all fell at the first hurdle. Champion in 2011, 35-year-old Stosur needed a wildcard into her 15th Open and bombed out 6-1 6-3 against Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova. Gavrilova, who continues to battle a foot injury, ended the 2019 grand slam season without a win following a 6-3 6-4 loss to Frenchwoman Fiona Ferro. Hon, a lucky loser from qualifying, had to settle for a $US58,000 ($A85,500) pay day after succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 to Russian Margarita Gasparyan. John Millman, Jordan Thompson, Alexei Popyrin, Thanasi Kokkinakis, Ajla Tomljanovic and Astra Sharma all open their campaigns on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST). Meanwhile Nick Kyrgios is already lighting up social media ahead of his first round match after hitting back at criticisms from Jim Courier and Martina Navratilova. The Tennis Channel tweeted “You never know what to expect when it comes to @NickKyrgios. Will he boom or bust this tournament??” accompanied by footage of former world No.1s Courier and Navratilova discussing Kyrgios’s prospects at the last grand slam of the year. Courier and Navratilova both addressed Kyrgios’s conduct, after he was fined $US113,000 (USA167,000) this month for his extraordinary meltdown in Cincinnati, where he branded chair umpire Fergus Murphy a “f****ng tool” and a “potato”. But Kyrgios made it clear he had no time for the pundits’ opinions. People that are irrelevant in my personal life are trying to make comments on my personal character. Well done 🥔’s https://t.co/1UHuQnaEwE Kyrgios will open his campaign at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday night against American Steve Johnson."

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 18.53 BST As the Vuelta a España celebrates its 25th edition since its move from April to September there is no debate about the success of a shift that seemed radical at the time. The third Grand Tour now has a settled place in the season’s narrative, offering a chance for revenge or redemption after the Tour de France, and this year is no exception, given an added twist by a particularly active summer transfer market. The biggest move of the summer was the former Giro d’Italia winner Tom Dumoulin’s transfer to the Jumbo‑Visma squad, who have made no bones about their ambition to shake the dominance of Ineos (formerly Team Sky) in the Tour de France. With a budget second only to the British squad, they clearly aim to match Dave Brailsford’s team for strength in depth. Even with Dumoulin waiting in the wings and the Tour revelation Wout van Aert recovering from a serious crash, Jumbo still field the strongest squad by far in the Vuelta, led by Primoz Roglic and the Tour de France third finisher Steven Kruiswijk, supported by the promising American Sepp Kuss. If they can finally take a Grand Tour win, that will tee up a duel next year with Ineos in the Tour; it might also enable Roglic or Kruiswijk to stake a claim as leader before Dumoulin appears. With Simon Yates resting and Chris Froome convalescing, former Vuelta winners are thin on the ground in this year’s field. Nairo Quintana starts among the favourites; after the late withdrawal of the Giro winner Richard Carapaz, he is likely to claim sole leadership of Movistar’s strong squad alongside another former victor, the world champion Alejandro Valverde. It is four years since the Italian Fabio Aru won his Vuelta and he has yet to show that was more than a flash in the pan. The Colombian Rigoberto Urán and the Dane Jakob Fuglsang have redemption on their minds after failing to live up to expectations in July, while among the other favourites the Colombians Miguel-Ángel López and Esteban Chaves will look to take full advantage of a mountainous route with a single flat time trial, on French soil in Pau 10 days in. With Froome, Geraint Thomas and the Tour winner Egan Bernal all absent, Team Ineos are built around the seasoned Dutchman Wout Poels and the promising young Briton Tao Geogeghan-Hart, who rode strongly at the Giro this year until his race was wrecked by a crash. Geogeghan‑Hart is just one of an up-and-coming generation of British riders along with the Cumbrian James Knox and Lancaster’s Hugh Carthy. After two years of British victories this year’s race is one where the UK contingent will be riding for experience. They all face one of the exceptionally mountainous courses which have come to typify the Vuelta in recent years. The first summit finish is as early as day five and is followed on day nine by a brutally short mountain stage in Andorra, and the time trial in Pau. There are no fewer than five mountain-top finishes in the eight days prior to the finale in Madrid and there are slim pickings for any sprinters daring enough to start. The fastest of their number is Sam Bennett, who is looking to become only the fifth Irishman to win a Vuelta stage, which would set him up nicely before his move next season to the super-strong Deceuninck squad. Primoz Roglic Fourth in last year’s Tour de France and third in this year’s Giro d’Italia, the former ski jumper starts the Vuelta with the strongest team behind him. The only question is whether he can deal with the repeated climbing and the unpredictable nature of the final Grand Tour of the year. Nairo Quintana Vuelta winner in 2016, and Giro victor in a far-off 2014, the Colombian should benefit from Richard Carapaz’s late withdrawal: for once, Movistar have “goal clarity” rather than merely hoping that weight of numbers will swing things their way. The only downside: he is leaving the Spanish team so they may not be 100% behind him. Sam Bennett The 28-year-old Irish sprinter has 10 wins to his credit this year - most recently three in three days at the BinckBank Tour - but this is his first Grand Tour start of 2019. He was smarting after being left out of the Tour de France and Giro, but will look to stake his claim as one of the finest sprinters of his generation."

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 14.46 BST Lone wolves. Terrorist cells. Bad apples. Viral infections. The language we use to discuss violent extremism is rife with metaphors from the natural world. As we seek to understand why some humans behave so utterly inhumanely, we rely on comparisons to biology, ecology and medicine. But what if we’ve been working in the wrong scientific discipline? What if the spread of hate is less like the spread of cancer through the proverbial body politic and more like … the formation of bubbles in a boiling pot of water? That is the contention of Neil Johnson, a professor of physics at George Washington University and the lead author on a study published this week in Nature analyzing the spread of online hate. If that sounds like an odd topic for a physicist – it is. Johnson began his career at the University of Oxford, where he published extensively on quantum information and “complexity theory”. After moving to the US in 2007, he embarked on a new course of research, applying theories from physics to complex human behavior, from financial markets and conflict zones to insurgency and terrorist recruitment. Johnson’s unusual approach has resulted in some surprising conclusions – he says all online hate globally originates from just 1,000 online “clusters” – as well as counterintuitive policy proposals. On Wednesday, he spoke to the Guardian about his findings. The interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. How did you go from physics to studying these social issues of violent extremism and online hate? Most people think of physics as smashing things up into smaller and smaller pieces, but there’s actually a whole wealth of physics which goes in the other direction and looks at what happens when you put things together. If I put molecules of water together, well, suddenly, I get a liquid and ice forms and icebergs form and the Titanic sinks. There’s all sorts of consequences of what happens when you put together objects, good and bad. We have a tendency to want to pin blame on individual objects, but you would never do that in the physics world. There’s no bad molecule that causes water to boil. It’s a collective effect. And so, we wondered if a lot of the social problems that we face are actually better looked at through that lens. The typical reaction is: 'But I’m an individual, I don’t behave like a molecule of milk.' Yeah, but collectively we do [For this study], we just naively said, well, what does the online world of hate look like? So we set about trying to work that out, and we found an unbelievable global network of hate. I study networks in biological systems, economic systems. This is the most complicated network I’ve ever studied – tenfold more complicated – because it mixes geography, continents, languages, cultures and online platforms. Trying to police it within one platform is a little bit like saying if you take care of the weeds in your own garden, you can eliminate the problem from the neighborhood. You talk about hate in terms of chemical bonds and “gelation theory”. How did you develop that framework? These are not analogies. We looked at the behavior of the data, of the numbers, and saw that it is similar [to chemical bonding] not just because the numbers change in a certain way, but actually microscopically, in terms of interactions. If you have milk in the fridge, gradually, one day that milk suddenly curdles. That is because microscopically, you’re getting this aggregation of objects into communities. And the math of that works perfectly well for the aggregation of people into communities. Now, the typical reaction is: “Oh, but I’m an individual, I don’t behave like a molecule of milk.” Yeah, but collectively we do, because we’re constrained by the others. So there’s only a certain number of things that we can actually do, and we tend to do them again and again and again. So it’s not an analogy. People say [online hate] is like cancer, it’s like a virus, it’s like this, it’s like that – no. It’s exactly like gelation, which is another way of saying the formation of bubbles. How did you create your map? We started with a seed of clusters that were already banned on Facebook, such as the KKK. We looked at what other clusters they connect to that also connect back to them and kept going through this chain. We found there’s a closed network of about 1,000 clusters, worldwide, online, across all platforms, propagating global hate of all flavors. Now, if there’s about 1,000 people in each of those (it’s actually between 10 and maybe up to 100,000, so let’s just say 1,000 on average) you’ve got 1,000 clusters of 1,000 people – that’s a million people. And that’s our very, very crude first estimate of the number of people online involved with this. That’s a startlingly manageable number – 1,000 networks. Not if you’re trying to find that among seven billion. But they’ve already done the job for you. They’ve already grouped themselves into community. Do you have a list of those 1,000 groups? That’s what we built. I was expecting us never to end the process. But we got to the stage where we thought, my goodness, we’ve mapped out the universe of online hate to some degree. Now we can begin to understand how interconnected things are and what things look like. What was the range of ideology in these hate clusters? Is it mostly antisemitism, racism, white nationalism? We thought we would see a discrete, well-defined set of boxes. But just as people haven’t been able to categorize [mass] shooters in defined sets of boxes, we didn’t find those online. Instead of it being like a menu of flavors, it’s actually a continuous spectrum. And it’s not a spectrum along the one line, it’s multidimensional. In the study, you describe forms of resilience by hate groups when they’re threatened. Particularly concerning was this warning: “Policing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse and will eventually generate global ‘dark pools’ in which online hate will flourish.” Can you describe how this works? What do you mean by a ‘dark pool’? Is that like 8Chan? No, it’s even worse. 8chan is a little bit of a remote island by itself. I’m talking about dark pools forming within the major commercial platforms that we “trust”. If you remove randomly 10% of the members globally, this thing will begin to fall apart When the KKK got banned from Facebook, they were looking for a platform, and suddenly, there was this welcoming committee on [the Russian social network] VK. It was like orientation week in college [with people saying], “We’ll hold your hand, we’ll take you to see the community, and you’ll find what you want here.” They’re now in a kind of close-knit group like freshman orientation, and they quickly can develop bonds to discuss what was it that got them banned, and therefore how to avoid it when they go back in. One of the adaptations was they then reinserted themselves into Facebook with a simple change of writing the name [KKK] in Cyrillic, the Russian alphabet. It looks pretty similar and yet a machine-learning algorithm doesn’t know about Cyrillic. It’s clever. How did you come up with your four policy proposals? If I want to stop water boiling, I don’t have to stop individual molecules from jumping up into the steam, I have to stop the bubbles from forming. We know that the big bubbles form from the smaller ones. And the big bubble today becomes old news for the next generation. [The first proposal] is to go after the smaller bubbles. Smaller bubbles are weaker, have less money, less powerful people, and will grow into those big ones. So eliminating small ones – and we showed this mathematically – rapidly decreases the ecology. It cuts off the supply. Number two is that instead of banning individuals, because of the interconnectedness of this whole system, we showed that you actually only have to remove about 10% of the accounts to make a huge difference in terms of the cohesiveness of the network. If you remove randomly 10% of the members globally, this thing will begin to fall apart. It’s a really interesting idea. It also seems a bit fraught in terms of our general understanding of what is fair, to say that just 10% of the people engaging in a specific negative behavior should be punished. Ostensibly all of the people involved in this have broken the terms of service of the platform, so all of the people should, in principle, have their accounts removed. Facebook’s trying to remove them all anyway. Our push is, just don’t go after the most important people first. Your second proposal involves deploying “anti-hate clusters” to engage with hate groups. How could that work? You get [the hate clusters] engaged in a skirmish, basically, and they think that that’s a kind of supreme battle. It slows them down in terms of recruiting; it just engages them in something that actually isn’t that important. So you’re saying that fighting with trolls online is actually worth your time? Right. But do it as a group, do it as a cluster. Don’t do it individually. It will break you. Are there examples of this that you’ve observed where it’s been effective? I haven’t. Like I said, this comes out of the idea of: how do I cancel a bubble? Well, there’s no such thing as an anti-bubble. But there is in physics the idea of just getting two [opposites] together and they should neutralize each other. They form a tightly bound pair, the plus and the minus. [The fourth proposal] is my favorite because it it really exploits the weakness that comes from the multidimensional flavors of hate. There are two neo-Nazi groups, both in the UK, both ostensibly wanting the same thing. But they don’t – one wants a unified Europe, the other wants to break everything apart and obliterate the rest of the countries. So introduce a cluster that draws out the differences. I don’t think that [the introduced cluster] would necessarily contain members of the public unless they were trained in some way. But it will certainly contain people who use good psychology, social psychology, and know some history that could actually engage. That strategy sounds like some of the tactics that the FBI used under Cointelpro when it was trying to pit different sectors of the civil rights movement against each other and taking advantage of potential ideological divisions to create a splintering effect. I don’t know that [history], and I certainly wouldn’t want it to be used in some bad way. But I see it as a way to wear individuals in hate clusters out. In the end, they’ll just get fed up. It’s not that it goes away. It’s just that now they’re actually hating the traffic more than they hate the Jews. It shifts the focus."
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/02/carlos-sainz-formula-one-mclaren,"McLaren driver wants F1 changes that will allow him to compete with the best and stand a chance of becoming world champion Fri 2 Aug 2019 17.22 BST


Last modified on Mon 5 Aug 2019 10.39 BST It would be easy to miss the determination that drives Carlos Sainz from his softly spoken voice and unassuming air. Yet the moment his piercing gaze catches the eye, it is impossible to ignore. It was unmistakable in Hungary before this weekend’s grand prix, when he declared that his enjoyment of the sport he has loved since childhood is marred only by frustration with Formula One’s two-tier structure that prevents him from fighting for a win. The McLaren driver has been going about his business this season with a quiet focus, delivering on the promise he displayed early in his career. Last weekend at the German Grand Prix, in wet conditions, Sainz claimed fifth place for McLaren. It was the team’s best finish since Fernando Alonso, Sainz’s childhood hero, finished fifth in Australia last year. That position is the highest the team have managed in the past four years. For Sainz it was the latest in a run of admirable drives by the 24-year-old, who is seventh in the championship. However, impressive as this has been, it is far from where Sainz wants to be. “I find it incredibly annoying going to every race to finish seventh, or even fifth,” he says. “I think everyone outside of the top six drivers finds it incredibly annoying. Some will say it, some won’t but everyone that’s in F1 at the moment has won in other categories. “Then you are here and you spend five years or even longer without really having even a taste of a victory. It shows the sport needs to adapt and change to make it more diverse.” He is not alone in an opinion that reflects the blunt reality of modern Formula One and he is understandably chafing at the bit for change. Sainz and his teammate, Lando Norris, have established McLaren as the best of the midfield teams, fourth in the constructors’ championship, 28 points in front of Toro Rosso. But the gulf to the big three of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull remains huge. McLaren are 147 points behind third-placed Red Bull. Since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014, no one from outside the top three has won a race. Worse still, since 2017 there have been only three podium places taken by a driver from the remaining seven teams. As Sainz points out, his chances are largely dictated by how the leaders are performing. “We still depend on others making mistakes to be better than seventh,” he says ruefully. “At the moment there are those three teams who are incredibly strong compared to us but I feel if they make mistakes we should be there to fish in the pond.” Sainz, clearly, did not come into Formula One to be dangling his hook on the off-chance of a bite. His goal was and remains to become world champion, a target set when he was 11 years old and told his father: “I want to be like Fernando Alonso. What do we need to do?” Fortunately his father was Carlos Sainz, the double World Rally champion. He had never pressured his son, who started karting for fun when he was three, into driving but realised he had been entranced by Formula One when the nine-year-old forced him to get up at 4am to watch the Australian Grand Prix. Taken on as a Red Bull junior and making his F1 debut for Toro Rosso alongside Max Verstappen in 2015, he performed well against the Dutchman but it was finding himself vying with Alonso that meant the most to Sainz. “I find Fernando an inspiration. In 2015 it was huge because in my first year in F1 I started pretty much every race next to him,” he says. “It felt special against my idol. I felt proud and privileged.” This was the period that forged Sainz’s belief in his ability to compete with top drivers, should he be given the machinery to do so. “Even if we were fighting for P7, I was fighting a world champion in his prime,” he says. “That gives me the confidence that, if I get the chance to fight for a win or for a world championship, I will know how to do it because I have already been fighting against a quality driver. It’s just that we are not able at the moment in the midfield to do that. I think 80-90% of the drivers in F1 now could fight for wins and world championships.” Norris has rightly attracted acclaim for a competitive opening to his rookie season and the two drivers enjoy a friendly relationship in the increasingly optimistic atmosphere at McLaren. Sainz however has been scoring more of the points, a fact doubtless not lost on his previous employers at Red Bull. In the last eight races he has outscored Red Bull’s Pierre Gasly by 48 points to 42. After 2016, as his chances of a drive with Red Bull declined, with Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo established at the team, Sainz understandably began considering his options. He was allowed to drive for Renault on loan in the latter part of 2017 and then 2018 but, when Red Bull chose Gasly to replace Ricciardo this year, he chose to leave Red Bull for good for McLaren. He is one of the few drivers from the Red Bull stable who has managed to continue his career in F1 having not had a shot at the senior team. With Gasly struggling, Red Bull may be regretting letting their man go while McLaren know what an asset they have, even if their car, which is not at its best in low speed corners, is unlikely to shine at the Hungaroring. For Sainz he is in a relationship where he is thriving. “This feels like a new start for me because it is my first two-year deal, a long-term project in F1,” he says. “People sometimes underestimate how important that is for a driver to perform. To have that confidence, that support, that mutual trust.” F1 has high hopes for the new regulations of 2021 going some way to levelling the playing field, as does Sainz, who desperately wants to compete against the best. Yet with that unassuming air, this young man is still quietly confident he is making his mark. “I think the people that need to see my talent are seeing it, people who understand F1 well are valuing my performance,” he says. “When you drive it is you, the car and your performance on track that counts. That is why I do it.” On track in Hungary, Lewis Hamilton looked on good form to exploit his Mercedes’ strengths through the twisting corners of the Hungaroring. He was quickest in first practice, just over 0.16sec clear of Verstappen and the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel. In an afternoon that was largely wet, and with relatively limited running, Gasly and Verstappen topped the time sheets, in front of the Mercedes of Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. With limited data gathered, qualifying on Saturday, which should be dry, may prove an intriguing prospect."

Last modified on Fri 2 Aug 2019 00.32 BST Lewis Hamilton has praised what he describes as a uniquely open and honest atmosphere at his Mercedes team that has enabled them to move on after a poor performance at the German Grand Prix. Before this weekend’s race in Hungary the British driver also said he would potentially welcome driving alongside Max Verstappen at Mercedes, as it would enable him to prove his driving rather than the car makes the difference. Hamilton finished 11th on the track at the last round in Germany, although he was promoted to ninth after both Alfa Romeos were penalised. He had spun off twice at Hockenheim, the first time hitting the wall, when the team had him on slicks as the rain returned. He damaged his front wing, requiring an immediate pitstop for which his team were not prepared. Mercedes admitted they had been found wanting in their strategy, while Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, crashed out at turn one while in fourth. Collectively it was their worst result since the Austrian Grand Prix in 2018. He and the team analysed everything that happened together and have emerged stronger. “It is super, super open, it is the best working environment,” he said. “I don’t think any team have the openness we have and I truly believe that is why we are able to move on. A lot of people shy away from being open or asking questions, here you can say absolutely everything and not have a filter. It means we advance so much faster. It is because of the philosophy that [team principal] Toto [Wolff] brings, it makes it easier to work and the same with [chief strategist] James Vowles, it transfers all the way down.” Having scored two points for ninth, Hamilton extended his championship lead over Bottas to 41 points. However, Verstappen has won two of the last three races. The Dutchman is 63 points behind Hamilton in third, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel a further 21 back in fourth. With Bottas’s contract up at the end of this season, a potential move by the 21-year-old Verstappen to Mercedes has been posited. It seems highly unlikely to happen but Hamilton said he did not fear having Formula One’s young charge alongside him. “I don’t know how that dynamic would work for the team, I am not saying it would or not, I see positives and potential negatives,” he said. “In some ways it would work well for me. I see stories that we have different cars and that is the only way [I beat him], so that would give me the opportunity to show that is not the case.” Hamilton confirmed he had largely recovered from the bug that affected him in Germany. He had been so unwell before Friday practice the team considered withdrawing him from the race but he managed to continue. “I am going to be 100% by the weekend,” he said at the Hungaroring. “I still need a bit more rest but I definitely feel in much better fighting shape. I am looking forward to getting back in the car, which is completely different to how I felt last Friday, when getting in the car was not a good thing.” Reports in Hungary suggest next year the F1 calendar will expand to 22 races. This season there have been 21 meetings and in 2020 new races are already confirmed for the Netherlands and Vietnam. Germany and Spain had been expected to fall from the calendar but it is believed Spain has done a one-off deal to host the race in Barcelona again next season. Mexico’s contract is up this year but is also expected to remain on the calendar. “22 races, that’s a lot of races,” said Hamilton, appearing somewhat daunted."
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/10/porto-townhouse-packed-with-vintage-finds,"This Portuguese home is carefully furnished with heirlooms – each with a story to tell Jo Leevers Sat 10 Aug 2019 10.59 BST You won’t find anything contemporary in Juan de Mayoralgo’s Porto home-turned-guesthouse. The pieces in his handsome townhouse are full of memories, including family hand-me-downs such as a bedroom cupboard once used to store potatoes, and a faded floral two-seater sofa, both of which belonged to his grandparents. “I can remember playing on the floor beside the sofa as a boy, eye-level with its fringed trim,” he says. The townhouse is narrow and deep – as wide as a single room and a corridor, and extending back the depth of four rooms. Steps from the front door and a huge, almost double-height entrance lead to a raised ground floor, with a bedroom, a reception room that has been turned into a bathroom, a dining room and kitchen. A wooden staircase winds up the house. Just to the left of the front door are a library-cum-sitting room, small bedroom and bathroom – De Mayoralgo’s private quarters, to which he retreats when guests are staying. On the first floor and second floors are more bedrooms and bathrooms. Ten years ago, De Mayoralgo moved to Portugal with his then partner. He worked in interior design in Lisbon for seven years before deciding to do something completely different. “There is a Spanish phrase, liarse la manta a la cabeza – wrap a blanket around your head – which means cover your eyes and just go for it. That’s what I did,” he says. He moved to Porto and rented a larger house than he needed, in an area of the city called Bonfim, which translates as “the good end”. “It’s calmer than the touristy streets downtown and there are still traditional cafes where you can get simple but very good food,” he says. He now makes a living by renting three bedrooms to paying guests for parts of the year. His home may be filled with heirlooms, but his local finds – from shapely mid-century chairs to side tables – come with their own stories, too. For example, the rosewood dining chairs are prototypes from the same Portuguese maker, each back carved slightly differently. Buying vintage pieces is so much more rewarding than buying new, he says: “You get a sense of the person who made them.” The house is filled with artworks and pots of oversized plants – single stems of sculptural tree philodendron and Monstera deliciosa are on display in science lab flasks. “Those, too, are the legacy of my mother and my grandmother,” he says. “Growing up in Spain, we’d get fresh flowers from the market every Friday.” De Mayoralgo rents his home long-term from the grandson of the master builder who originally constructed a row of six townhouses in this street in the 1930s. He sold off the others to members of Porto’s growing bourgeoisie, but kept this one. “It has beautiful green tiles on the facade, marble lining the hallway, cast iron radiators and plasterwork that is just slightly more ornate than usual,” De Mayoralgo says. “He definitely kept the best for himself.” The plumbing and wiring needed an overhaul, but the basic structure of the house was sound. De Mayoralgo decided to install two new bathrooms; he came up with the idea of setting them inside plasterboard cubes, so they function as a room within a room. “I didn’t want to change the architecture – this way, all the fixtures, lighting and tiling are self-contained. They don’t impinge on the original features.” The kitchen, however, remains untouched in all its 1920s glory. It features prettily domestic tiling and a large marble sink set slightly low down for modern, taller occupants: “I have to stoop a little to wash up,” he says. He often recommends the city’s markets, museums and vintage shops to guests who are interested. But one suspects that it’s the sense of family history in the house that keeps them coming. A collection of handprinted menus hangs in the hall, dating from the 1940s. “They were all collected by my grandparents, starting with their wedding dinner and progressing to my mother’s first communion,” he says. “The food and the wines conjure up the era.” In a similar way, that is what De Mayoralgo’s house does, too. “I’m not casual about what I buy. I take time to think about my compositions in all the rooms, but I am very sentimental.” • myhomeinporto.com"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.15 BST Scores of taller phone masts could be built across the British countryside as part of government plans to eliminate mobile reception blind spots. The digital secretary, Nicky Morgan, said she wanted to shake up planning restrictions to allow mobile phone networks to build ground-based masts exceeding the current rules prohibiting structures over 25 metres on public land. The move came as the government launched a competition for rural areas to host tests of groundbreaking 5G applications as part of plans for a wider rollout of the communications technology. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Morgan said plans also included firms investing in shared masts, allowing phone users to switch between providers to find the best signal. She said: “To give such a proposal the best chance of success we need to make it easier for industry to build, share and upgrade mobile infrastructure. This means planning rules will be relaxed to enable existing ground-based masts to be strengthened without prior approval to enable sites to be upgraded for 5G and for mast-sharing.” She stressed the need to “get the balance right” between preserving the “sacrosanct” countryside and improving connectivity. The £30m 5G competition will select up to 10 rural locations to run trials of 5G-related technology, which would involve superfast 5G test networks being set up. The government said it hoped the programme, named the Rural Connected Communities competition, could help stimulate investment in 5G and help countryside communities take advantage of the technology. Similar schemes have already been set up in Orkney to remotely monitor salmon fisheries and improve the efficiency of wind farms, and in Shropshire, where 5G trials have been used to help the farming industry with targeted crop-spraying and soil analysis with drones and tractors. Morgan said: “We’re investing millions so the whole country can grasp the opportunities and economic benefits of next-generation 5G technology. “In modern Britain, people expect to be connected wherever they are. And so we’re committed to securing widespread mobile coverage and must make sure we have the right planning laws to give the UK the best infrastructure to stay ahead.” Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said: “This funding falls far short of the ambitious rollout we need to boost our digital infrastructure nationwide. 5G and full fibre will be the basis of the innovative, green technologies that will underpin our future economy, but the UK’s digital infrastructure is lagging embarrassingly behind. “This government must take bolder, faster action to deliver the digital infrastructure we need.”"

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 12.15 BST On the southern French coast between Toulon and Marseille, Sanary-sur-Mer has always been a popular destination for boat-lovers and beach-goers and last year its market was voted the most beautiful in France. Smoke from the roasting chickens spreads over the stalls of olives, lavender honey and trays of pickled garlic and on to the giant swordfish and tuna on the tiny metal counters on the harbour. I join the queue for cade, a spongy pancake made from chickpea flour, baked in the food truck’s wood-fired furnace, which has been a tradition in Sanary for more than 200 years. During summer weekends, owners of the town’s hundred or so pointus, brightly painted wooden fishing boats, take people for free tours of the harbour and surrounding waters. It is organised by the Association des Pointus de Sanary, all wearing marinière striped jerseys. Jean Luc Ercolani looks like a rebel. No marinière for him. He helps me into his boat and I see a tattoo of a kraken poking out from under his T-shirt sleeve. He tips his seafaring leather hat and we’re off towards the rust-coloured coastline. “I named the boat Serenità [serenity], which is my philosophy on life,” says Jean Luc. “She has an old soul. I used to have a motorised dinghy but I prefer the authenticity of the pointu. They were fishermen’s boats so are very stable: they had to go out in all weathers.” Jean-Luc’s pointu has a lovingly varnished teak deck and dates from the 1970s but others in the harbour were built in the early 1900s. “Sanary is proud of its pointus,” he says. “In December they cover the boats in fairy lights.” Back on shore, I wander along the port esplanade where Le Galion has already started dishing out moules frites and crêpes. Visitors are boarding a ferry to pastis baron Paul Ricard’s island Les Embiez, and the bright red Sanary Explorer, half-boat, half-submarine, takes trips to see the starfish, sea urchins and meadows of Neptune grass. The walk to Portissol beach takes around 15 minutes, up the steep Montée de l’Oratoire to Notre-Dame de Pitié. The chapel was founded in 1560 and looked after by hermits who lit warning fires if there were Barbary pirates, the Duke of Savoy or a storm approaching. At the top of the hill is the Villa Baobab, home of the late scuba-diving pioneer and underwater film-maker Jacques Cousteau, who ended up in Sanary after fleeing the Nazis along with members of the German and Austrian literary scene, Thomas Mann, Joseph Roth, Klaus Mann and Stefan Zweig. Portissol beach fills up early but is then abandoned at lunchtime as sunbathers head for the nearest beach restaurant, leaving a waffle pattern of towels on the grainy sand. A family waves me over. “We saw you on the boat this morning!” They look at each other and laugh, three generations sharing a beach towel. “You looked a bit green. I said to Pierre-Alain [her son], ‘Look at him gripping the sides!’” The Mistral wind can make things very choppy in Sanary-sur-Mer. I walk along the Quai Sud, a walkway at the side of the beach where there’s a seawater lagoon reserved for children practising snorkelling, and, a little further on, a diving zone where buoyant adolescents are leaping backwards into the sea. At the far end of the rocks is a cove where the smokers, dogs and inflatable beach balls hang out, none of whom are allowed on the main plage. Portissol has a thick hemline of washed-up Neptune grass between sand and sea. “It’s illegal to remove it now,” explains Axel Zoellin, who works at the beach restaurant Ô Petit Monde. The grass protects the beach. “It gets very busy here as the beach is sheltered from the wind and popular with families. We prefer to go swimming in the rocky creeks along the coast.” Axel grew up nearby, like his co-worker Luna Penn, but they actually met in Australia. Un vrai petit monde. The trendy restaurant is a cabin of modern furniture and driftwood, open every day, even during the winter, with live music on Sundays and five guestrooms upstairs. “We can seat 200 people, but out of season, it’s just locals who come,” says Zoellin. Sanary’s 21m-high stone watchtower is the emblem of the town and stood there, isolated, from the middle of the 13th century until 1507 when local inhabitants were allowed to build homes attached to its base. It stays open until 9.30pm on summer weekends, so I climb up the stone stairs and ladders to its terrace, perfect for watching the sunset. Dinner is at Hôtel de la Tour which has been run by the Mercier family since 1936. I have the fish soup and monkfish medallions but every other table has ordered the poisson en croûte de sel, a whole sea bass baked inside a mound of salt. Waiters crack open the salt crust with wooden mallets and ladle away the crystals, a theatrical excavation that serves two to three. My wife looks up from her scampi and we decide to be braver next time. Midnight, back on the portside, the night market is coming to an end and a street performer finishes with Charles Trenet’s La Mer under the harbour’s palm trees. I take the late-night trip on the Sanary Explorer, whose underwater lights pick up the moray eels phytoplankton and wake up any fish who’d already turned in for the night in the Neptune grass. • Hôtel de la Tour has doubles from €88 B&B; its restaurant serves a two-course lunchtime formule for €24.

But, before it was possible to read our reporting instantaneously, the introduction many of our international readers had to the Guardian was through the Guardian Weekly, which was first published 100 years ago today. The Weekly has been providing a snapshot of world affairs for a century; for Guardian readers who left the UK behind as well as those who had never stepped foot in the country. The Weekly began, in the wake of the first world war, by reproducing articles from what was then the Manchester Guardian for readers around the world. It evolved to include reports from Le Monde and the Washington Post and, later, the Observer and our global network of websites. In October 2018, we relaunched the Weekly as a newsstand magazine after 99 years as a newspaper. To celebrate this anniversary the Weekly team have produced a special edition – available on selected newsstands today – featuring original Guardian Weekly front pages covering momentous events from the Wall Street crash to the election of Donald Trump. The Weekly has evolved many times: from wispy wartime paper stocks to a still-beloved airmail-paper edition; from the recent half-Berliner size through to the magazine. Guardian and Observer reporters have been witnesses to history in every corner of the planet – and much of their work has featured in the Weekly. The Guardian Weekly’s centenary comes at an important time for the Guardian and Observer. Our daily newspaper will mark its 200th anniversary in 2021 and, thanks to our readers in all formats, we are now in a stronger financial position than we have been in decades. Throughout a period of disruption in the newspaper industry, readers of the Weekly have provided some of the Guardian’s most loyal support. If you’re interested in joining them, please click here."
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure,"Secret plan to block any delay in leaving EU is likely to anger European leaders at G7 summit Toby Helm and 
Heather Stewart Sat 24 Aug 2019 21.02 BST


First published on Sat 24 Aug 2019 21.00 BST Boris Johnson has asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, whether parliament can be shut down for five weeks from 9 September in what appears to be a concerted plan to stop MPs forcing a further extension to Brexit, according to leaked government correspondence. An email from senior government advisers to an adviser in No 10 – written within the last 10 days and seen by the Observer – makes clear that the prime minister has recently requested guidance on the legality of such a move, known as prorogation. The initial legal guidance given in the email is that shutting parliament may well be possible, unless action being taken in the courts to block such a move by anti-Brexit campaigners succeeds in the meantime. On Saturday Labour and pro-remain Tory MPs reacted furiously, saying that the closure of parliament, as a method for stopping MPs preventing a potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, would be an affront to democracy and deeply irresponsible, particularly given the government’s own acceptance of the economic turmoil no-deal could cause. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Any plan to suspend parliament at this stage would be outrageous. MPs must take the earliest opportunity to thwart this plan and to stop a no-deal Brexit.” The prominent Tory remainer and former attorney general Dominic Grieve added: “This memo, if correct, shows Boris Johnson’s contempt for the House of Commons. It may be possible to circumvent the clear intention of the House of Commons in this way but it shows total bad faith. Excluding the house from a national crisis that threatens the future of our country is entirely wrong.” Senior MPs believe Johnson may think he can win a confidence motion if MPs call one, and believe that having done so he would have a mandate to drive through a no-deal Brexit even if he had to shut down parliament to do so. Any move to prorogue parliament would enrage the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who said recently at the Edinburgh festival that parliament could stop a no-deal Brexit. The campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller has said she will spearhead an immediate legal challenge should Johnson try to shut down parliament in order to drive through a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of MPs. A government source did not deny that legal advice had been sought. They added: “As a matter of routine, No 10 officials ask for legal and policy advice every day.” Johnson has said he is “not attracted” to the idea of proroguing parliament and that he wants a Brexit deal, but has repeatedly refused to rule it out. After becoming prime minister he immediately promoted Dominic Raab, the first senior Tory to propose the idea of shutting parliament to get Brexit through, to the post of foreign secretary. The email shows that the feasibility of a five-week parliamentary shutdown is under active consideration, from soon after the date on which parliament returns on 3 September, until the eve of the last EU summit before Brexit, on 17 and 18 October, when it will be too late for MPs to block no deal. The revelation will also anger EU leaders as Johnson makes his international summit debut at the G7 in Biarritz this weekend. Johnson was due to meet the US president, Donald Trump, for talks on Sunday, with Brexit and international trade high on the agenda. He will also meet EU council president Donald Tusk who said on Saturday that he would not cooperate with Johnson on a no-deal Brexit, but rather wanted to find a way forward with him to secure a deal on issues including the Irish backstop. Tusk said as G7 leaders gathered that he was “willing to listen to ideas that are operational, realistic and acceptable to all EU member states, including Ireland, if and when the UK government is ready. The one thing I will not cooperate on is no deal, and I still hope that prime minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as ‘Mr No Deal’.” Pro-remain MPs have spent the summer recess planning how to block a no-deal outcome and, if necessary, force an extension to the Brexit deadline beyond 31 October, when parliament returns on 3 September. Among the options being considered are taking control of Commons business for enough time to pass legislation that would mandate the prime minister to seek another extension. An alternative backed by some remainers is to amend Brexit-related legislation to force an extension. EU leaders will be closely monitoring the clashes in parliament in September. Brussels sources say the bloc is reluctant to make fresh concessions before MPs have had an opportunity to tie Johnson’s hands by seeking to block no deal. Speaking en route to the French resort, the PM urged MPs not to consider trying to do so. “I think it’s parliament’s job now to respect not just the will of the people but to remember what the overwhelming majority of them promised to do over and over and over again, which is to get Brexit done, to respect the will of the people, and to come out of the EU on 31 October. That is what I am confident our parliament will do,” he said. The leaked email will fuel speculation that Johnson is prepared to make the delivery of a “deal or no deal” Brexit an issue of parliament versus the people. The email examines whether the prime minister could thwart MPs’ plans by shutting parliament until a Queen’s speech would herald a new parliament on 14 October. A government source said there was a definite and clear plan to prorogue parliament being hatched by Johnson’s closest advisers. In particular, the memo examines whether Johnson could circumvent a previous amendment, championed by Grieve, that was inserted into a bill relating to the Northern Ireland Assembly earlier this summer. It requires ministers to report regularly to parliament on progress in restoring the Stormont Assembly. The email suggests the Grieve amendment does not necessarily prevent the prime minister activating the prorogation plan. The news will add greater urgency to talks that will take place on Tuesday between Jeremy Corbyn and cross-party MPs on how to prevent no-deal. Corbyn has said he will call a confidence motion in the government when parliament returns, and if successful, would seek to become prime minister for an interim period before calling a general election. Starmer is understood to want MPs to try to pass legislation specifically to mandate the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension."
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/27/public-sector-to-launch-mass-legal-battle-over-pension-reforms,"Teachers and doctors claim changes to pensions in 2015 were ‘discriminatory’ Owen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent Tue 27 Aug 2019 00.01 BST Mass legal claims on behalf of teachers and doctors alleging that changes to their pensions in 2015 were discriminatory are being launched against the government. After successfully winning a similar pension case on behalf of judges, the London law firm Leigh Day is preparing employment tribunal cases for public sector workers. The British Medical Association is also coordinating action with doctors over pension reforms that they claim could inflict huge financial losses on individuals by the time they retire. The latest wave of legal action follows the supreme court’s refusal earlier this summer to hear an appeal by the government against a landmark ruling that found alterations to the terms of judges’ and firefighters’ pensions were discriminatory. About 250 judges whose pension entitlements were cut won their discrimination claims against the Ministry of Justice. The reforms introduced a cut-off age preserving better conditions for those approaching retirement but transferred younger judges to a less generous scheme. Lawyers argued the distinction amounted to age discrimination. Since far more women and those from BAME backgrounds made up a large proportion of the younger workforce, they maintained it also constituted sex and race discrimination. The judges’ claims were joined by similar submissions on behalf of firefighters when the case reached the court of appeal. The precise terms of any improved pension terms have not yet been agreed. The supreme court decision has set a precedent for other public sector workers. It has been estimated the government may have to find an additional £4bn to pay for improved pensions. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair, said earlier this summer: “Although doctors’ pension schemes are different, the BMA believes the underlying legal principles are essentially the same and we want to bring a challenge on behalf of the UK’s younger doctors regarding the legality of the 2015 NHS pension scheme. “We have made our intention and position very clear and we expect to support many more doctors in the coming month.” The National Education Union (NEU), the largest union representing teachers, is not backing fresh legal action at this stage. It is waiting for clarification on what additional compensation will be made available for those in the new pension schemes. An NEU spokesperson said: “The government has stated that the position established in these cases will be applied to all public sector schemes. Compensation will also therefore be applied to members of the teachers’ pension scheme and local government pension scheme who were denied protection, although the extent of this compensation will not be known for several months.” Leigh Day, which specialises in group actions, says it may eventually lodge claims on behalf of tens of thousands of teachers, doctors and other public sector workers. Nigel Mackay, a partner at Leigh Day, said: “The government is short-changing hundreds of thousands of hard-working doctors and teachers. “Public sector pension schemes have been known to provide better than average benefits to reflect the valuable contribution that those in the public sector make to society. However, the changes made by the government have unfairly left younger public sector workers out of pocket. “As a result of the supreme court ruling in June the government has run out of options in relation to those judges and firefighters who have brought claims. “However, it has not made any commitments to remedy the issue for any judges or firefighters who have not brought claims, or any other public sector workers, including doctors or teachers, that have been affected by the same changes to their pension policy.” The legal claims will be lodged with the employment tribunal. Younger teachers, Mackay said, are losing out on extra lump sum payments that were available under the old scheme. A government spokesperson said: “We respect the court’s decision and confirmed in a written statement to parliament on 15 July that we accept the judgment applies to all main public service pension schemes. This includes the pensions schemes for the NHS and teachers. “We remain committed to public sector pensions that are fair to both workers and tax payers. We are now considering how best to implement the decision.” "

Last modified on Wed 1 May 2019 21.00 BST Today, we have announced that the Guardian has successfully completed its three-year turnaround strategy — we have hit our goal of breaking even, and made a small operating profit on our path to sustainability. This means that the money we make from advertisers combined with what we receive in the generous support from you, our readers, has this year covered the cost of producing the journalism that informs and inspires millions of people around the world. Our unique ownership model means we are not controlled by a billionaire owner, or a group of shareholders demanding financial returns — any profits made, and all financial contributions from readers, are reinvested directly into our journalism. We have listened carefully to your thoughts and opinions over the past three years, and this has helped inform the creation of a business model in which our editorial independence remains paramount, and which keeps Guardian and Observer journalism open and accessible to everyone regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. We would never have been able to achieve this without you. Three years ago we faced a very different situation, when a broken business model for news was threatening to destroy media organisations around the world: print advertising was collapsing, newspaper sales were declining, and the promise of digital advertising growth was going almost entirely to Google and Facebook. These threats still exist, and while we’ve found a way to counter them, the situation remains fragile. Now, the challenge is to keep this going for the long term, to remain sustainable so that we can keep producing meaningful journalism. Investigative reporting is expensive, whether that’s exposing the Windrush scandal in the UK, the Cambridge Analytica scandal in Silicon Valley, or the long-term environmental damage taking place in the US, Australia, and around the world. We will continue to dedicate as many resources as we can to investigations, the climate emergency and the global shifts taking place in politics, culture and society. Just as we did three years ago, we have now set a new ambitious goal: to achieve the support of two million people around the world by 2022. This level of support will mean we can continue to investigate and illuminate the most significant global stories of our times. As editor-in-chief I set out the principles for Guardian journalism in my essay on the Guardian’s purpose, and these matter more than ever. At the Guardian we endeavour to bring clarity in a world where facts should be sacred but are too often overlooked, and imagination in an age in which people yearn for new ideas and fresh alternatives to the way things are. We try to make the space for hope, delivering journalism that speaks to the urgency of this moment, but lasts for more than a day. In the last three years, more than one million people around the world have chosen to support The Guardian financially. Thank you to all of you who have supported us and we hope more of you will consider joining us on this mission — you can do this through voluntary contributions, subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly, or as part of our patrons programme. As we approach the Guardian’s 200th anniversary in 2021, your support will help ensure we can keep holding the powerful to account, with purpose, for many generations to come. Thank you. Support our journalism by making a contribution, subscribing or by becoming a Patron."

Last modified on Wed 3 Apr 2019 22.33 BST The Guardian has set a target to attract 2 million paying supporters in the next three years, with the aim of securing the future of its journalism output in a tough media environment. After a three-year period during which costs have been reduced, revenues increased and the landmark of 1 million paying contributors across web and paper reached, the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and the Guardian Media group chief executive, David Pemsel, unveiled the next stage of their strategy. “One of the great successes of the past three years has been the willingness of readers to support our journalism and our purpose,” they said in an email to staff on Wednesday. “As we look ahead, we are setting a new goal for the whole organisation: to attract 2 million people to support the Guardian financially by the end of our 200th anniversary year, in 2022.” Viner announced last year that more than a million individuals had already donated since the Guardian began its current membership model three years ago. It aims to help offset declining revenue in some parts of the business with reader contributions, enabling the Guardian website to remain available online for free. The email did not confirm whether Guardian News and Media, the parent company of the Guardian and the Observer, had hit its target of producing an operating profit by the 2018-19 financial year. However, it said it remained on track to break even, following years of heavy losses, with headline financial figures expected to be announced by the end of April. “Three years ago, the Guardian faced severe financial challenges,” they said in the memo. “Our operating losses were forecast to exceed £80m in a single year, our print revenues were in structural decline, our international businesses were growing but unprofitable, and digital ad revenues began flowing to the tech platforms rather than to publishers at an increasingly rapid rate. “It was clear that we needed to take urgent action to safeguard the future of the Guardian in perpetuity. In January 2016, we launched our new relationship strategy, aiming to deepen our reader relationships, increase the financial contribution from our readers, evolve our advertising proposition and reshape our organisation and our finances.” They said costs had been reduced by 20% in the last three years, a period during which the number of people employed at the Guardian fell, while revenues had grown at at a steady pace. Despite industry-wide circulation declines, the company has also committed to the physical newspaper for the foreseeable future, having converted to a tabloid format at the start of 2018 and signing a five-year contract with Trinity Mirror to produce the print edition. The memo highlighted the focus on building a core daily readership rather than chasing global reach at all costs, with 40% more regular readers than three years ago and a growing number of print subscribers. It also said Guardian US and Guardian Australia had each doubled their revenues since 2016, and were both financially sustainable in their own right. Guardian News and Media is ultimately owned by the Scott Trust, which uses an endowment built up from past investments to subsidise the organisation’s ongoing operations. “In cash terms, which is the best measure of our financial sustainability, we expect our cash outflow in 2018-19 to be within the £25-30m range which the Scott Trust can currently fund each year,” said Viner and Pemsel. They also outlined their vision for the next three years, which includes investing in journalism, growing the Guardian’s international presence, and increasing the diversity of both reporting topics and staff."

Essentially a red lentil stew (or some would say thick soup) laced with turmeric, ginger, chilli and cumin, dahl comes together quickly with minimal preparation and needs little more than rice to make it a complete dish. While the brilliance of dahl rests heavily on its simplicity, I’ve recently become an advocate for making dahl more.

My two favourite toppings are full of colour and character – vibrant beetroot raita, spiced with curry leaves and mustard seeds, delivers a tart edge, while zesty carrot and peanut salad brings freshness and crunch. Add some sautéed greens – try spinach, chard or kale – for added heartiness.

Apparently, many people have pointed out on social media that the gentleman in question bears a resemblance to me. I feel a bit sorry for him. I suspect it is inconvenient enough being a wanted man without being widely judged to look like me. At least the chap caught on CCTV last year in Blackpool robbing some booze looked like a proper A-lister, David Schwimmer. This particular master criminal must be very hurt indeed to look only like little old me. People often seem to see me in others; it can be quite dispiriting for all concerned. Classically, I’ll be outside a football ground or in some other crowded place. Someone will approach me and say they have a mate who looks “the image” of me. At which point, either a photograph will be produced or, more than once, the doppelganger himself will be fetched and come shambling into view. It is always the same: he will be, in my eyes, much heavier than me, with an even chubbier face, and generally more unattractive. And, what’s worse, I’ll look into his eyes and understand that he is thinking exactly the same about me. We will be photographed together and walk away, never to see each other again, united in disappointment. And then there is the Ray Mears problem. As with my larcenous lookalike, I’m often mistaken for him. “Oh,” someone will say. “I love your programmes.” “Why thank you,” I reply. Then they say something about eating bugs or bark or bears or whatever, and my heart sinks. Many times I’ve even signed myself Ray Mears; I didn’t want to disappoint.

Last modified on Tue 13 Aug 2019 06.03 BST In 2012, Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer, met a man she calls her “psycho ex”. The man swept her off her feet and treated her like royalty, which is why it took a while for her to notice how he had began to slowly violate her privacy: he took photos of her without her consent, demanded to know her whereabouts constantly, and grew furious when she would not respond to his calls. She broke up with him. He then tried getting into her apartment, sent her hundreds of threatening messages, and sent emails attaching photos of her in compromising positions – cc’ing judges and lawyers she knew. The police responded to her concerns with a pattern she would encounter repeatedly throughout her career: they shrugged and told her there was nothing they could do. When she took it before a judge, he responded that preventing Goldberg’s ex from posting compromising pictures of her online violated her ex’s free speech. The sense of injustice she felt at the time now fuels her work as a victims’ rights lawyer specializing in sexual privacy violations. “If somebody is injured, the person or entity responsible must pay,” she writes in her new book, Nobody’s Victim. “This concept drives a lot of the work I do with my clients today.” Over the last three years, Goldberg has become a leading expert on violations facilitated by the internet. Her clients range from schoolchildren to millionaires, but all have been in the crosshairs of malicious men (and it’s almost always men) who ruin the lives of their victims. An example of Goldberg’s work involves a client she calls “Francesca”, who believed a recent fling was using a compromising photo of her in his Facebook profile, while posting under his own name. Every time he posted, the photo would appear. She also received other mysterious forms of digital harassment, such as threatening text messages and emails from people claiming to be the wives or girlfriends of men she had relationships with. Goldberg didn’t think Francesca’s fling was responsible – she knew this level of harassment usually came from someone who is even closer to the victim. She soon discovered the harasser’s identity after her associate dug through a PDF Francesca had received and found the name of the last person to edit it. Goldberg asked Francesca: “Do you know a Juan Thompson?” Francesca replied: “He’s my boyfriend. Why?” Thompson had been harassing Francesca in various guises, then acting as a comfort blanket in real form. Goldberg helped obtain protection for her client, then advised her to break up with him. He did not stop. Instead, he escalated his attacks for months, avoiding arrest and targeting her family – then he reported fake bomb threats using Francesca as the perpetrator. He was eventually arrested. In 2017, Goldberg was representing Matthew Herrick, a client whose scorned former boyfriend used the popular gay dating app Grindr to harass him. This time, the ex had created numerous fake accounts with a call for sexual encounters using Herrick’s face and location. What Goldberg calls “a storm of horny strangers” proceeded to harass Herrick day and night, sometimes getting aggressive. Some of the messages sent from the impersonating accounts indicated that the recipient need not take no for an answer, which created a serious threat of sexual assault. One avenue Goldberg took was confronting Grindr’s refusal to act. Grindr’s defence arose from US legislation, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). It grants companies immunity from repercussions for what users post, since the companies are not viewed as publishers of the content. Goldberg believes this leglisation “is the enabler of every asshole, troll, psycho and perv on the internet”. Because internet companies are not legally bound to protect their users, Goldberg says, many of them don’t. She points out that services like Twitter and Facebook may have terms and conditions, but they’re not enforceable. “Until terms and conditions are enforceable in court, I don’t give a shit what these companies say are in them,” she says (Goldberg is very liberal when it comes to swearing). The only available fix is for lawyers like her to “be able to sue the fuck out of them for product defects”. After moving through various courts, the Grindr case was dismissed because of Section 230. “Grindr had enabled and facilitated Matthew’s abuse,” she says. “They knew it was happening. They could have stopped the strangers showing up at Matthew’s door. But legally they didn’t have to do anything to keep Matthew safe because of the fucking CDA.” This immunity given to tech companies, she believes, “is a government handout to the one industry least deserving of it. Besides the gun industry, name me one other industry that can’t be held accountable to people harmed by their product?” The law professor Danielle Citron, in her book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, notes that the label “cyber” is important to attach to various malicious conduct. “[It] adds something important … It captures the different ways the Internet exacerbates the injuries suffered.” Letters can be thrown away, slurs dismissed – but the internet not only facilitates the act of harassment itself, it becomes a monument of harassment a victim must endure whenever they are online. It can also be witnessed by potential employers or family. “Revenge porn” victims suffer the most when their private images are disseminated throughout the net without their consent. Each posting requires individual takedown notices, which is time-consuming work. Goldberg’s firm has removed tens of thousands of images from the internet, the majority of them being revenge porn – sexually explicit private pictures of someone disseminated without their consent. Some of them, Goldberg says, are doctored images of her clients made to look like they’re naked. I ask her about Deepfakes – fake audio or video that can look extremely convincing. She tells me her firm saw the technology coming. With deepfakes, “you not only have innocent people imposed into videos of fake scenarios, but you also have guilty people that have new deniability when videos show them in real scenarios.” However, with revenge porn, Goldberg and her colleagues have made enormous strides. Recently, New York passed a law criminalising the distribution of any image or video showing an identifiable person’s genitals and other vulnerable areas without that person’s consent. One issue remains: it only targets defendants who acted with the intent to harm the victims. Writing in the Harvard Law Review blog, Citron and her colleague Mary Anne Franks note that while this would find footing in some cases like Thompson’s, it is a shortcoming. “People disclose private, intimate imagery of others without consent for a myriad of impersonal reasons,” the professors note, “including a desire to gain social status, to brag, to make money, for sexual gratification, or to provide ‘entertainment’.” This means men like Hunter Moore, who profited off of revenge porn, could not be prosecuted. Goldberg says she’s aware of the criticisms, but is glad nonetheless for the law’s existence. It not only means at least there’s now a deterrent, but that victims can take matters into their own hands. “For instance,” she tells me, “if law enforcement is moving too slowly, a victim can get an order of protection from family court. If the offender violates that, [the offender faces] an automatic arrest and the additional crime of violating the family court order.” I ask Goldberg whether she thinks law students are being adequately taught when the internet is often relegated to its own separate subject in schools. She has a firm position. “Law schools that aren’t infusing internet law into every subject are not preparing students for the present. It’s not enough to just have a class called internet law. It needs to be worked into all courses.” She notes the intersection of free speech law and Twitter harassment; human rights law and Facebook’s link to Myanmar violence; criminal law and computer fraud. In the final chapter of her book, Goldberg advises a young law student to “find your biggest obstacle, that thing that makes you feel most powerless, and ask yourself, ‘How do I fix this?’ That’s the fight you should devote your life to.”"

It doesn’t mean abandoning friendships, says Mariella Frostrup, but don’t be afraid to keep a distance when needed Mariella Frostrup Sun 25 Aug 2019 06.00 BST


Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 09.52 BST The dilemma I’m 34 and have been in a close friendship group with four other women since university. Our relationship has been a constant comfort, but during the past year I’ve found it incredibly difficult to connect with them as all four have had babies. Suddenly our WhatsApp group looks more like Mumsnet – and I just can’t relate. I don’t know if I want kids or not. My husband puts no pressure on me, but this is bringing out the worst in me. I feel left behind, confused and judgmental as these friends enter motherhood. I feel isolated and incapable of contributing, and when I do I feel disingenuous. I try to widen the conversation, but it always reverts back to babies. I don’t want to lose these people, but I feel marginalised, as if I’m fundamentally missing out on some intensely female purpose. How do I step back without being overly dramatic? Mariella replies It’s definitely a problem. I am sympathetic. But stick with me first, because I have to draw attention to how emotionally over-sensitised we’ve become as a species. Growing up, friends shacking up before we do, marriages and divorce, babies born and infidelities committed – they’re all part of life’s rich pageant. Some are profoundly upsetting, some manageably so, and others so natural a part of life’s flow that they should barely bother us at all. Some of these emotional traumas are dumped on us, some committed by us and some are not directed at us at all. In the latter case, it’s generally our own unresolved issues that make us vulnerable to being wounded. Moving in unison with our peer group through formative experiences is something we generally leave behind in late adolescence or, at latest, post-college when we diverge on to more individual paths. In childhood, many of our compulsions are the result of instinct rather than individual choice. The reason Harry Enfield’s sketch about taciturn Kevin entering his teens is so hilarious is that it’s universal. Each and every child will experience similar antisocial and easy-to-caricature hormonal impulses as they segue from childhood to adulthood. Becoming a parent is such an all-consuming activity, certainly initially, that most of us do become baby bores Later, when we “mature”, what we choose, rather than societal expectations, shapes our life as we branch off from friends and family in myriad directions. At a certain point we all have to diversify, embark on independent lives and try to make a good life for ourselves. Having teens, as I do, is a reminder of that early impulse to move as one through the world with our peer group. Everyone is trying to look the same, act the same, they listen to the same music, wear the same clothes and have the same hairstyles. As we become individuals, with our own ideas and beliefs, insecurities and intolerances, we are released from the bondage of fitting in. You’ve reached just such a stage when adult friends are moving into the next phase of their lives, whether that’s defined by career choices, political beliefs, relationship commitments or, indeed, becoming parents. What you’re entirely right about is that the latter, parenting, initially makes bores of us all. To be in their proximity in the early days requires remarkable tolerance and discipline not to scream out: “Yes it’s a blinking baby… so what!” Becoming a parent is such an all-consuming activity, certainly initially, that most of us do become baby bores – and that’s hard to be around if you haven’t succumbed to procreational impulses. You say you’re not sure whether or not you want children and that’s a choice for you and your husband alone. It may be that you’re just not ready to go down that path, or that parenting simply isn’t for you – so to remain vulnerable to damage from the choices of those around you is unsustainable. My sneaking suspicion is that it’s not your friends’ choices to have babies that’s bothering you but your own lack of clarity on the issue. Bruce Springsteen’s promise in love is equally apt in enduring friendship: “I’ll wait for you, And should I fall behind, Wait for me.” Those we rely on and love will all drift from our immediate grasp at some point and the ebb and flow of friendships and relationships is as natural a cycle as waves on the shore. To fully realise our own lives, we need to branch out and step back, surge forward and move sideways – and for all of us that’s an individual path complete with distractions and decisions. While your friends are immersed in parenthood and you are trying to decide, don’t be afraid to set your boundaries. Be the occasional voice of reason bringing the wider world into your WhatsApp group, even if you keep yourself at arm’s length. It won’t be long before life leads you back into step, or the road you choose takes you far away into different more stimulating territory. Occupy at least some of the time while your friends are preoccupied by thinking hard about what you want out of your life (and less about what they are doing with theirs). Friends are friends, even when our experiences are at odds, so it’s an imperative life skill to develop resilience and patience for the moments when you slip apart.

Last modified on Sun 25 Aug 2019 19.58 BST New evidence showing that private-school pupils in England and Wales are not only taking easier qualifications than state-school ones, but being given the same credit for them by the most prestigious universities, will infuriate everyone who believes in fairness in education (and in life, since the routes to so many later opportunities are mapped out at school). Put together with concerns over the impact of the new GCSEs on lower-ability pupils, the sense is growing that yet another Conservative educational reform has been bungled. The point of the changes to GCSEs pushed through by the former education secretary Michael Gove was to raise standards by making them harder. Almost all headteachers believe that this aim has been met. Increasingly, though, it appears that the price of this ratcheting up of difficulty was too high. Not only has a new schism opened up between the private and state sectors, since some private schools have refused to teach the new exams and instead opted for IGCSEs – International GCSEs – that are more similar to the old version (often retaining a mixture of exams and coursework). Existing inequalities in state schools have also been exacerbated by reforms whose overriding purpose was to make it easier to differentiate between the highest achievers (by creating two grades, 8 and 9, in place of the old A*). How to ameliorate this situation – without causing pointless disruption, undermining public confidence or worsening the situation with regard to the recruitment and retention of teachers – is the question that the new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, must now answer. Universities must be called to account straight away for the reasoning behind their decision to treat IGCSEs as if they are equal to the new GCSEs, even though they are said by the government not to meet “the new gold standard” and are excluded from official performance tables on this basis. Given that the first new GCSEs in English and maths were taken two years ago, the onus must be on universities and Ofqual, the exam regulator, to demonstrate that the students due to begin courses shortly have had their achievements at age 16 correctly weighted. Ministers must also explain why guidance in this area has not previously been issued. At least one private-school head warned more than a year ago that state-school pupils could suffer as a consequence of being forced to sit harder exams. Why, then, did ministers leave it to Labour’s Lucy Powell to investigate? But the problem with the new GCSEs goes beyond the knock-on effect on higher education, important though this is. For some students and teachers, the new exams were welcomed as a challenge – and those who performed well under demanding conditions deserve praise. But reports of increased stress and low morale among pupils must not be shrugged off. Putting children off learning in their mid-teens is a serious mistake. In particular, criticisms about the new exams’ unsuitability for pupils with special educational needs and in lower-ability groups must be addressed, and modifications considered. Nor can ministers, including Mr Gove, avoid taking responsibility for the new system-wide problem that they have created – with some children of fee-paying parents now studying for different exams from their state-school peers. Given the entrenched inequalities of the British education system (though Scottish children take different exams, the private/state divide in cities such as Edinburgh follows a similar pattern), and the role of private schools in perpetuating hierarchies of social class and position, this new parting of the state/private ways was the very last thing the country needed. How can pupils, parents or the public be expected to embrace qualifications that are shunned by the most academically competitive fee-paying schools? Mr Williamson, should he try to rectify these problems, can at least claim to be a new broom. But he – or his successor, depending on how long the government lasts – will have their work cut out. Flaws in the new GCSEs are far from the only Conservative schools policy that should, in as orderly a way as can be managed, be swept away as soon as possible."

First published on Mon 26 Aug 2019 20.13 BST A few hours after the unveiling of a statue here to honour the great Althea Gibson – who won Wimbledon in 1957 and partnered Britain’s Angela Buxton to win two slam doubles titles – the American’s spiritual heir, Venus Williams, progressed to the second round of the US Open in a blistering hour and six minutes. Route 66 for Williams – a two-times winner here at the turn of the millennium who turns 40 next summer and shows no signs of retiring – was a 6-1, 6-0 destruction of China’s Zheng Saisai on the court named after Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby. It is the best she has played in a little while. Williams next plays the Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who beat Jo Konta two weeks ago in Montreal. Konta was the first of the small British contingent to successfully negotiate the first round on a fresh, crisp Monday, with the actor Tom Hiddleston watching as a guest in her box as she overcame a mid-match dip to beat the accomplished Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 in just over two hours in front of hundreds of noisy British fans among the 2,800 who squeezed into the seats on Court 17. Billie Jean King earlier compared Venus to the tall, athletic Gibson, a pioneer for African-American women across sports in the ’50s, whose friendship with Buxton lasted until the former’s death at 76 in 2003. Buxton, who commutes between Manchester and Florida, helped raise more than a million dollars to lift her friend out of penury shortly before she died. Buxton, whose capacity for straight-talking has not diminished throughout her 85 years, observed that the Gibson statue “doesn’t resemble her at all” then took a dig at the All England Club for never giving her life membership because, she maintains, she is Jewish. It is a subject the club rarely discusses. “They haven’t given me membership, although they say they have,” she told the Guardian after the unveiling of the statue. “And I say, ‘What happened?’ They said, ’You refused it.’ I said, ‘I don’t refuse it now. So send it along.’ They said, ‘Oh, no, no, no, we can’t do that.’ I said, ‘Why is that? They said, ’You’ve gone to the end of the queue now.’ “This was 1980. It is a laugh – if you can see the funny side of it.” The British No 1 and 16th seed Konta met Hiddleston in New York three days ago. “He turns out to be a big tennis fan, so I invited him down and he brought some of his co-stars [in Betrayal, which is playing on Broadway],” she said. “I had some of my friends there as well, so I had a lot of great support in the box.” She was coy about where she and her group had bumped into Hiddleston because, she said: “Once I say, you guys will figure it out and I don’t want to encroach on his privacy. I’m sorry.” No betrayal there, then. Konta nevertheless appreciated the support of Hiddleston and the rest of the British fans, as Kasatkina, who had won their previous two matches, rallied in the second set before some wretched serving let her down. Her last four strokes of the match contributed to her 12 double faults. Konta plays the world No 61, Margarita Gasparyan, on Wednesday. The Russian, who turns 25 next week, was impressive in beating the Australian Priscilla Hon 7-6 (4), 6-4 in an hour and a half on Court 14. On a windy Court 10, Dan Evans soaked up 12 aces to negotiate his way past the elegant French strokemaker Adrian Mannarino. He was happy with the 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 win in just over three hours but not his performance, and said Mannarino, an inventive and difficult opponent, was doing to him what he regularly does to others. Harriet Dart is out of the tournament, lasting just an hour and 11 minutes against the Romanian qualifier Ana Bogdan, who had too many weapons for her and won 6-3, 6-1. Dart, who has had some good results this year and reached the third round at Wimbledon, said: “She played a pretty perfect match, I couldn’t really do much.” On bigger stages on day one, the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, began the defence of his title in excellent style, beating Roberto Carballés Baena in under two hours, while the former Wimbledon and Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber was a shock loser in three sets to the unseeded Kristina Mladenovic."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 17.15 BST “God save little shops,” sang the Kinks on their 1968 single The Village Green Preservation Society. More than half a century later, that wish lives on for the founder member and guitarist Dave Davies, who is fighting to save a historic shopping arcade near where he grew up in north London, which is expected to be demolished by developers and replaced with high-rise flats. The still-touring Davies has stepped into a battle being repeated across the UK as investors seize on struggling high streets in towns and suburbs that have been battered by online shopping and rising business rates, and seek to turn them into housing. Policymakers believe a crisis last year during which the number of shops lying empty rose by more than 7,500 can be halted by turning them into homes. In the past five years, there has been a net loss of more than 1,000 independent shops, according to the Local Data Company (LDC). Davies, 72, joins those who fear the changes risk ripping individuality and identity out of local communities. He is backing calls to save the art deco Grand Arcade in North Finchley, which was a short trolleybus ride from where he grew up in Muswell Hill with his brother Ray Davies. Its eccentric row of shops once included a music store where Davies bought guitar strings. Now there is a jeweller’s, a bric-a-brac shop, an immigration lawyer, a craft shop and a photo studio. All this is facing oblivion despite the government’s heritage body, Historic England, declaring the 1937 building “one of the highlights of the town centre”. Speaking on a visit to the arcade last week, Davies said: “Little shops matter because people matter. “Feelings are attached to things, not just people. Certain clothes in little shops. It’s more personalised, more individual, more quirky. You get more unusual things. Some people don’t care, but I do. Ray was right about it before anyone else on the Village Green album.” The net number of store closures on Britain’s high streets has increased every year since 2015. In 2018, London had the greatest number of closures, Scotland had a net loss of 119 stores, and there was a 10.5% increase in closures in the north-west, according to the LDC. But sometimes the stores are taken over by other occupants. At the Grand Arcade, the Art Against Knives charity has occupied what was once the music shop, in an attempt to encourage vulnerable young people off the streets with music production sessions and a nail bar. If places such as the Grand Arcade go, “we lose personality and individualism”, said Davies, as he riffled through LPs by Doris Day, Shakatak and Felix Mendelssohn in the Green Room charity shop. “I think we are at a time now when we need to celebrate individualism rather than trying to make everything the same,” he said. “This sort of place brings people together. I think about new people or immigrants moving to the area and they would love to own a little shop rather than being stuck in a big box.” The local planning strategy calls for the building’s replacement with up to 12 storeys of flats and offices above shops. It cites “tough economic conditions and changing consumer habits” as altering the face of the high street, and suggests more leisure, office and residential uses. According to council papers, the private developer, Joseph Partners, funded the creation of the planning strategy, contributing £140,000 towards salaries. A spokesperson for Barnet council said of the arrangement: “Although funding was provided privately, which sometimes happens with master plans and SPDs [supplementary planning documents], the work was led entirely by Barnet council planning officers, following normal due process.” Jonathan Joseph, the company’s head, denied there was any conflict of interest. He said Joseph Partners had no say in the recommendations to demolish the arcade and said the jury was still out on what would happen, with a consultation on detailed plans to start next month. “Is it a pleasant piece of architecture? Yes. Is it historically important? No,” he said. Ian Dunn, a local graphic designer who is campaigning to save the arcade, said: “This is a unique part of North Finchley. You have to have a bohemian funky place like this for people to express themselves. It can’t be all coffee shops. All we have up here now is McDonald’s and KFC and their litter all over our floors.” Mukesh Rathod, who runs the 21-year-old Gold Leaf jeweller’s, said the council’s suggestion the arcade was struggling was “rubbish”. He added: “There is no need to close this. It’s all very well having the big shops like Next and Primark, but if this goes they won’t survive because the arcade brings people here.” Marissa Ajapidi, who runs Recycled Inspirations, an arts and crafts shop, said she was so busy she was expanding into the neighbouring unit. “It’s crazy,” she said. “This is something totally different.” Ray and Dave Davies, the fraternal driving force behind the Kinks, are back in tandem after decades of animosity and have produced a large number of new ideas for songs, some of which are “really good”, Dave Davies has said. The band’s pioneering lead guitarist, who is now based in New Jersey, has been in the UK working with his brother. “Me and Ray are talking. Or talkingish,” he said. It has been enough for the pair to write together again, 55 years after they changed the face of pop music with You Really Got Me, which introduced a new distorted guitar sound achieved by repeatedly slashing the paper cone of Dave Davies’ £10 guitar speaker with a razor blade. They subsequently fell out repeatedly – including over who wielded the blade. “I’ve been working with Ray,” said Dave Davies. “We’ve been working on some ideas. There’s a lot of it. Some of it is OK and some of it is really good and needs tarting up, knocking into shape as it were. “It’s going OK. We’re getting on OK, that’s the main thing. He can be cheeky. He wants what he wants. It’s just brother shit. When the music works, everything else is sod it, it will be all right.” The Kinks are rereleasing their 1969 album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) in October, but there is no schedule yet for the release of any new material. Less than three years ago, Dave Davies described his 75-year-old brother in an interview as “sly, manipulative and nasty”."

Last modified on Fri 23 Aug 2019 00.35 BST It is the naked truth that Brooks Koepka has been the dominant figure in golf for two seasons now. The 29-year-old has taken his scenario literally, with a high-profile photoshoot for ESPN’s annual The Body issue this week. Koepka dons only a birthday suit amid a variety of on and off-course poses. Koepka is not particularly bothered about shifting focus away from these photos; victory at the Tour Championship, and the $15m that comes with it, would further confirm his recurring ability to walk the walk. The next photo could well be more orthodox, featuring Koepka with trophy in hand. Koepka’s 67 at East Lake afforded him a share of the lead with Xander Schauffele and Justin Thomas. That Schauffele shot 64 on day one – the lowest score in the field – yet ties Koepka at 10 under par owes everything to this event’s new format, whereby players started from a handicapped position. This paled into insignificance, though, as Koepka for the first time addressed – as he so eloquently put it – “dropping my robe”. The four-times major winner had been criticised for weight loss associated with the shoot, which took place before the Masters. “It’s one of those things where all these people that talk crap and whatever on social media, they don’t have the balls to do it,” Koepka said. “And they wouldn’t look that good. “It was something I enjoyed. I was looking forward to it for months. It’s something I definitely don’t regret doing. It’s been enjoyable to see the pictures over the last couple of months, see all the hard work I put into it and see the results. To get chosen for that, you have to be one of the best in your sport. So I’m doing something right on the golf course. It was something I wanted to do and it was fun. I enjoyed it. I’ve got nothing to be ashamed of.” Rory McIlroy said he had been invited to do the same as Koepka in 2015 but declined. “Brooks worked hard for that,” said Mcllroy, who is one shot off the lead after a 66 that included three birdies in his closing six holes. Thomas, who started with a two-stroke lead over the field, signed for a 70. Tommy Fleetwood’s 69 means he is eight behind."

Last modified on Mon 26 Aug 2019 07.25 BST Cuba has introduced sweeping reforms of its fishing laws in a move seen as smoothing the way for possible collaboration with the US on protecting their shared ocean, despite Donald Trump’s policy of reversing a thaw in relations. The move is the first time the text of an environmental law in Cuba specifies the need for scientific research, which experts say will mean greater reliance on state-of-the-art US technology. “If we don’t look for collaboration we can’t have the full picture,” said Jorge Angulo Valdes, a Cuban marine biologist at the University of Florida. Ocean science must continue to transcend political pressures, he said. “Trump is doing everything he can to close the doors on collaboration. Cuba is doing everything to make it easier to keep those doors open.” Cooperation is as vital to US interests as it is to Cuba, Angulo-Valdes said. The two countries are separated by just 140km (90 miles) of water, and Cuban waters provide spawning grounds for species of snapper, grouper and other commercially important reef fish in the US. Maintaining healthy numbers of bonefish, a lucrative game fish in south Florida, for example, depends on protecting the species in Cuban waters, where the bonefish spawn, said Angulo Valdes. The reforms are Cuba’s first major overhaul of fishing laws for more than 20 years and a major step for preservation of some of the world’s most important marine ecosystems, said Dan Whittle, Caribbean director of the US-based Environment Defence Fund (EDF), which has worked with Cuba on conservation and sustainable fishing and brokered several of its key environmental agreements with the US. “These laws also level the playing field because now the US can say that their neighbours are using the most up-to-date science,” said Whittle. Despite having some of the world’s best preserved marine ecosystems, Cuba has seen declining fish populations, including of key commercial stocks like grouper and snapper. Angulo Valdes said: “Marine resources weren’t doing well, nearly 80% were in critical condition. The old law didn’t cover the private sector and wasn’t working.” The new laws aim to curb illegal fishing, recover fish populations and protect small-scale fisheries, with increasing use of data-limited methods that allows fisheries to assess which species are most vulnerable, even when scientific data on specific stocks is scarce. The laws also separate sport and recreational fishing and brings fisheries under the management of the food industry ministry (Minal). A key feature is a new licensing framework for the growing private commercial fishing sector in Cuba. Established in 2009 to increase seafood production and create jobs, this sector now has 18,000 private commercial fishers operating out of more than 160 fishing ports to provide seafood to state markets. After former president Barack Obama normalised relations with Cuba in 2014, the countries signed landmark environmental deals and in 2017 the countries signed a pact to jointly prevent and clean up oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, shortly before Trump took office. Trump has tightened the US economic embargo on the Caribbean island and imposed heavy travel restrictions, after years of a boom in US travel to Cuba. In May the Associated Press said restrictions has begun to hurt scientific cooperation and reported Patricia González, director of the University of Havana’s Centre for Marine Research, as saying that Cuban ocean scientists were being granted fewer visas to travel to the US and that some of their American counterparts were worried about travelling to Cuba in case they faced retaliation on their return home. “[Under Trump] NGOs have continued doing ground research involving scientists from Cuba and the US but it has been slower and more under the radar,” Whittle said. Cuba’s past isolation was a factor in preservation of its stunning coral reefs, including its famed Gardens of the Queen, a national park covering 850 square miles that was named by Christopher Columbus to honour Spain’s Queen Isabella I. “Even before the new law, the country had some of the most successful conservation strategies in the world,” said Valerie Miller of the Environmental Defence Fund. “Cuba was talking about climate change years before many others and stayed ahead in conservation strategies. It has an extremely healthy coral reef with some of the world’s best biodiversity.” Whittle said: “[The reforms] are important for the people of Cuba but are also a significant step in international efforts to preserve some of the world’s most important coral reefs, sharks, rays and other marine life.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/the-guardian-weekly-is-100-the-wall-street-crash-to-suez-part-one,"Our weekly print magazine is celebrating a century of news. Here’s how it covered the 1929 financial crisis; the Hindenburg disaster; the bombing of Hiroshima and Suez Thu 4 Jul 2019 09.00 BST After a six-year bull market, the Wall Street bubble burst on Black Thursday: 24 October 1929. As losses of $5bn were reported, President Herbert Hoover tried to reassure the country and bankers attempted to prop up the market. But, within days, at the close on Black Tuesday, losses had worsened. It wasn’t until July 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the market bottomed out, down 89% from its peak. The Weekly published reports, comment and editorials, noting the record-breaking volume of trading as investors raced to offload their holdings (so fast the tickers could not produce tape fast enough), and pondering the causes of the bubble – cheap credit and a popular belief that securities would only ever rise in value. [This leader is from the first day of the Wall Street crash when £1bn was wiped off share values.] We have known many financial crises in this country, but never a gambling crisis of the magnitude witnessed in the past few days in America. There is nothing the matter with American trade; there has been no setback in industrial prosperity; nothing has happened to cause the collapse except the pricking of a bubble. The bubble was the belief … that it is possible to buy a security for a certain sum of money, to sell it again later at a higher price, and to continue the process indefinitely. The astonishing thing was that the process had been going on for several years … This was partly due to the fact that American industry progressed steadily and that its increasing profits did justify increasing security values. But this basis of good reason served mainly to stimulate the public expectation of quick capital appreciation. It is very easy to secure by capital appreciation in a month a return greater than a full year’s dividend. And as this was what many people actually succeeded in doing, month by month and even year by year, it is perhaps not surprising that some of them almost came to believe that they could go on doing it for ever. The greater the number of people who were persuaded to act upon this belief the truer it seemed to be. Until at last a large part of the nation seems to have gone security mad and to have thought of little else but how to raise money to put into some Stock Exchange security. To what extent the purchases were financed on credit it is impossible to say, but clearly the amount of borrowing was so considerable as to cause grave concern to the authorities of the Federal Reserve banking system. They resorted to the traditional method of curbing Stock Exchange speculation by a restriction of credit; but with little or no effect, owing, apparently, to the growth of the investment trust and the accumulation of resources outside the control of the federal reserve system. So at last the dawn of a speculator’s paradise seemed to have broken. Up to a few weeks ago there was nothing to indicate how soon the illusion was to be shattered. For a long time, the Weekly ran a front-page summary of the week’s news, before exploring stories in detail later on. This particularly busy edition from May 1937 featured news of George VI’s coronation; street battles in Barcelona during the Spanish civil war; fallout from the bombing of Guernica on 26 April; ominous warnings about Italian belligerence and Japan’s policy in China. Most spectacular was the Hindenburg crash in New Jersey, which killed 35 people on 6 May – with 62 escaping. The Guardian’s reporter captured some of the horrors of the crash. By Guardian correspondent The great German airship Hindenburg was wrecked at Lakehurst airport, New Jersey, on Thursday night of last week, with a loss of 35 lives. The airship had just completed a crossing. She arrived over Lakehurst during a thunderstorm at about four in the afternoon. Her commander decided that it would be safer to delay the landing till the storm was over. The airship hovered in the neighbourhood for three hours. The work of mooring her was in progress when a loud explosion occurred; the airship burst into flames and fell to the ground in ruin. The cause of the accident is under investigation. According to one account there was some misunderstanding among the ground staff about the hauling of the mooring ropes, with the result that the tail of the airship hit the ground and rebounded. Other accounts attribute the disaster to lightning, and there is also a theory of sabotage, though the evidence, if any, upon which it rests is not apparent. Some of the passengers who had been waving greetings to those on the ground were shot out of the observation windows by the force of the explosion. Some members of the crew could be seen dropping with their clothing in flames, and many of the occupants were entangled in the fiercely burning mass which came to the ground. As a new Labour government took office in the UK and the Allies pronounced on the future of a defeated Germany, news came of the devastating conclusion to the war in the Pacific: the atomic attack on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, after Japan’s armed forces’ refusal to surrender unconditionally. Between 117,000 and 250,000 were killed in the world’s first atomic explosion (three days later another “A-bomb” was detonated over Nagasaki). In its 10 August issue (evidently printed on reduced-quality paper affected by rationing), the Weekly reflected on the implications of the bombing. It also featured a piece by science correspondent JG Crowther on the role of the paper’s home city in the birth of the bomb. Guardian Weekly editorial Momentous happenings have fallen thickly this last 12 months, but it is difficult to think that any single newspaper has ever contained news of so many far-reaching matters as are briefly dealt with in this issue. The completion of a new Labour Government in Britain – the first with a majority in the House of Commons – would have been sufficient in the way of “big news” for any ordinary week. It fell in the same seven days as the release of the Potsdam pronouncement on the future of a defeated Germany. Then, while the British people enjoyed their first August Bank Holiday since the end of the war in Europe, President Truman announced that American and British scientists had produced an atomic bomb and that it had already been used against the Japanese. He called it the greatest achievement of the efforts of science, industry, and the military in all history. After that, Wednesday’s news of a declaration on the future of Austria, Russia’s entry into the war on Japan, and an Allied agreement on the War criminals seemed superfluity. “Sixteen hours ago,” began President Truman’s statement issued on Monday [6 August], “an American aeroplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base.” But that one bomb, a small one in visible physical magnitude, had a significance that has given a tone of awe to all the utterances in which its story has been given to the world. It is not only that it has a power two thousand times greater than the ten-ton “grand slam,” which was the largest the RAF dropped on Germany: there is the further momentous fact of what the President has called “the harnessing of the basic power of the universe” first to the purposes of war, but potentially to useful production. Mr Truman added: “The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East. Mr Churchill, in a statement which he prepared while in office, and which [new prime minister] Mr Attlee issued with his own introduction to reach us simultaneously with Truman’s announcement, strikes an even deeper note. He says: “This revelation of the secrets of nature, long mercifully withheld from man, should arouse the most solemn reflections in the minds and conscience of every human being capable of comprehension. “We must indeed pray that these awful agencies will be made to conduce to peace among the nations, and that instead of wreaking measureless havoc upon the entire globe they may become a perennial fountain of world prosperity.” “By God’s mercy British and American science outpaced all German efforts,” says the ex-prime minister [Churchill]. The Suez fiasco delivered an ugly final chapter to Britain’s long imperial history. The military misadventure by Britain, France and Israel to thwart Egypt’s President Nasser’s nationalisation of the Suez Canal was condemned internationally but, in the UK, much of the press supported the endeavour. The Guardian and Observer (not then under the same ownership) were thought to be the only national papers who argued consistently against the action. It was said that this fiery editorial, written the day after Israel attacked Egypt, by Guardian editor Alastair Hetherington was quoted on the paper for years. David Astor’s Observer leader on 4 November 1956 was hailed as one of the most significant of the 20th century. Guardian editorial The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow. There was, admittedly, about one chance in twenty that it might put out the fire. By sheer weight it might have extinguished the flames, temporarily at least. But it is far more likely to lead Britain into direct war with Egypt, and perhaps with the whole Arab world – as, on the latest reports, it seems to be doing. What is more, countless other nations will consider Britain and France to be in the wrong. As the two governments must have known, it was exceedingly improbable that Egypt would withdraw its forces to the west of the canal. Why should it, except -possibly through fear of fighting Britain? Already it is engaged with the Israelis east of the canal and in the Sinai desert. If they are with-drawing from their grandiose raid – which for them would be the only sensible course, militarily and politically – the Egyptian command will want to pursue them and harass them as they go. For the Egyptian forces to retreat behind the canal, one hundred miles inside their frontier, would be an admission of defeat. In the present mood of Egypt – of the government, army and people – it was most unlikely to happen. In the event, Egypt rejected the ultimatum. It declines to retreat. The Prime Minister sought to justify the ultimatum by saying that we must protect our shipping, our citizens, and “vital international rights”. But what possible right have we to attack another country? The British and French military action will be -flagrant aggression. Protection of shipping – or for that matter of rights of transit through the Suez Canal – is no cause for making war, unless it is done with the authority of the United Nations. Nor can an assault on another country be warranted on the ground that we wish to safeguard the lives of British and French citizens (In fact our action is likely to place them in greater jeopardy). Nothing in the Charter, or in acknowledged international law, permits armed intervention in such a cause. As for the vital “international rights” of which Sir Anthony [Eden] speaks, what are they? The British and French Governments have acted in a rash and precipitate fashion. To much of the world they appear to have seized upon the shallowest excuse to reoccupy the canal zone as they wanted to do a week ago. The Prime Minister says that no other course is open to us. He is gravely mistaken. The proper course would have been to call on Israel, through the Security Council, to withdraw its forces immediately to its own territory. At the same time both Egypt and Israel should have been reminded of the tripartite declaration. This would have been the way to promote peace. Instead the government has taken us well on the way to a bigger war. The raid towards Suez has been a most dangerous move – and it seems likely to bring Israel into still greater difficulties. At present the best thing the Israel Government can do is to get its troops back within their borders. The sooner it does so the better [… ] The Israel Government ought by now to grasp the point that if it holds on in Egyptian territory it will be buying successes today at the expense of ruin tomorrow. But, as must be bitterly acknowledged, the British and French Governments are following a similar path. Yesterday’s events – and today’s – are all too likely to have a tragic ending for the West. • Part two: the moon landings to the genocide in Rwanda• Part three: The 9/11 attacks to the election of Trump"

Last modified on Sat 24 Aug 2019 23.55 BST Emmanuel Macron has asked for world powers to help Brazil and its neighbours fight the fires raging in the Amazon and to plan huge replanting programmes. The appeal came as the French president piled pressure on Brazil’s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has been accused of fuelling the burning of the rainforest. As environmental protesters marched nearby, the G7 summit’s, opening meeting was dominated by the spectre of economic repercussions for Brazil and its South American neighbours and showed how the Amazon is becoming a battleground between Bolsonaro and the west. Many governments have become alarmed that vast swathes of the Amazon are going up in smoke, affecting biodiversity and worsening the climate crisis. Macron wants to bring other leaders onside to his hard line with Bolsonaro. The Brazilian president suggested, after talking to Donald Trump on Friday, that some countries would press Brazil’s case at the G7 in the face of criticism from France. Paris and Dublin have threatened to block the Mercosur free-trade agreement between the EU and South American nations if Brazil does not act to slow the deforestation of the Amazon. In Biarritz, EU council president Donald Tusk increased that pressure yesterday. He said that although the EU stands by the free-trade agreement with South American nations, “it is hard to imagine a harmonious process of ratification by the European countries as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction of the green lungs of planet earth”. UK prime minister Boris Johnson underlined his concern as he arrived in Biarritz but he said he would not let it affect trade ties with Brazil. “I am horrified by what is happening in the Amazon basin, and as I said yesterday the UK stands ready to help in any way that we can to extinguish the fires, and to protect habitat and biodiversity,” said Johnson. However, he said he would not be willing to follow the example of France and Ireland in refusing to ratify the EU’s trade deal with Mercosur. “I think I would be reluctant to do anything at this very difficult time for global free trade, to cancel another trade deal,” Johnson said. Asked whether Macron was making a mistake linking the deal to the environment, he added: “I think we need to look at the commercial thinking that may underlie that.” UK trade minister Conor Burns, a longtime ally of Johnson’s, toured Brazil on a trade mission this week, leading the Labour party to accuse the UK government of “cosying up” to the Bolsanaro regime."

Last modified on Tue 27 Aug 2019 14.27 BST Ben Stokes has revealed he celebrated his miraculous Ashes-saving innings at Headingley with his England teammates by visiting a McDonald’s drive-thru. The 28-year-old hit an unbeaten 135 – including eight sixes – as he won the third Test virtually single-handed on Sunday. England completed a national record run chase of 359 to seal a one-wicket victory, with Jack Leach standing firm alongside Stokes in an unbeaten 10th-wicket stand of 76, of which the No 11 scored just one, the run that brought the scores level. Stokes described how the team celebrated in a column for the Daily Mirror, writing: “We started in the changing room and they had the full replay of the partnership with me and Jack Leach on the TV, so we all watched it together with Alastair Cook who came up to see everyone. “It was great to relive it all and the atmosphere in the dressing room was just brilliant, even with three guys stood in the bathtub, and I have no idea why. Joe Denly, Jos Buttler and Rory Burns were all in there singing songs and asking people to get in the bath with them, but it was just too hot so we had to go outside. “We went out to the Dickie Bird balcony and [Jason Roy] said: ‘Are we going to go out on the pitch or what?’ So we went to the toilet, grabbed the speakers, and got out there where Leachy gave everyone an action replay of his single. It was a great celebration amongst us before we went back to the team hotel to catch up with friends and family. “Me, Buttler, [Chris] Woakes, Burns and [Joe] Root all jumped in an Uber and got £55 worth of McDonald’s drive-thru on the way. There were quarter pounders and Filet-O-Fish flying everywhere.” Stokes also paid tribute to his wife, who supported him when he was charged with affray following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in 2017. Stokes was found not guilty last year. He said: “Clare has been brilliant and so supportive throughout the years. Your family go through everything with you, good and bad, so it is great to be able to celebrate with them at times like this. I didn’t actually see Clare until late in the evening when we got back from the ground. I still had my training gear on and my England cap. First thing she spotted was the bag in my hand. She said: ‘Oh, so we’ve been to McDonald’s, have we?”’"
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/hugh-brogan-obituary,"Leading historian of the US admired for his acclaimed biographies of Alexis de Tocqueville and Arthur Ransome Tony Badger Tue 20 Aug 2019 18.15 BST


Last modified on Tue 20 Aug 2019 21.24 BST Hugh Brogan, who has died aged 83, came to reflect that when he wrote his bestselling Penguin History of the United States of America (1990, originally published by Longman in 1985) his work was suffused with a sense of optimism about the country’s future, for all its faults and despite Vietnam and Watergate. If he had been writing that history now, he felt that the book could not have been underpinned by that hopefulness. The Penguin history was a unique achievement. An older generation of British Americanists had written one-volume histories of the US, but they were brief interpretive essays designed to explain America to a British audience. A younger generation of Americanists in Britain would not have dared to attempt such a sweeping full narrative from prehistory to Ronald Reagan. We lacked Hugh’s range of learning, perhaps his confidence and ambition, and certainly his stylistic excellence. In the US such large histories were the product of multi-author teams supported by specialists in publishers’ textbook divisions. Hugh, by contrast, flew solo. He was as fascinated by the nitty-gritty of American politics as his father, the Glaswegian historian and author Sir Denis Brogan, had been. His interest was sharpened by his time on the Economist (1960-63) after graduating and his Harkness fellowship to the US (1962-64). Kennedy (1996) was his underappreciated later biography of the president of the time, John F Kennedy, for the Longman’s Profiles in Power series. In a sympathetic, but not uncritical, study, he captured an essential truth of Kennedy’s learning on the job as president: no intellectual but “a quick study”. Hugh also understood the importance of second-order politicians who wielded such local power in the federal system. It was a great pity that his study of Louisiana politician Huey Long, New York planning official Robert Moses, anti-Mafia senator Estes Kefauver and Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago was never published. The work was to be titled All Honorable Men. His subjects had faults – corruption, womanising, alcoholism, authoritarian tendencies – but they were, in Hugh’s words, “what made the whole caboodle work”. American academics would sometimes say with unconvincing self-deprecation how much they learned from the study of America by European observers from the French political scientist and diplomat Alexis de Toqueville to historian and ambassador James Bryce, to Hugh’s father. Hugh’s first research interest in the US revolved round De Toqueville. He was part of an international team editing the French aristocrat’s complete writings and wrote a short study, Tocqueville (1973), of the life and works. It was not until he retired that he completed his greatest research task, Alexis de Tocqueville: Prophet of Democracy in the Age of Revolution (2006), an acclaimed biography of an aristocrat who unexpectedly found robust freedom and vitality in a fiercely democratic society. Hugh never lost his childhood ability to recite long passages of Victorian and Edwardian poetry. His declamation of Macaulay’s Horatio at the Bridge could reduce both himself and his audience to tears. It was entirely appropriate that he rescued two late Victorian literary figures who wrote for children from the massive condescension of posterity: Arthur Ransome and Rudyard Kipling. His formidably researched biography of Ransome (1984) transformed our understanding of the author of Swallows and Amazons, chronicling Ransome’s role as a sympathetic and involved observer of the Russian Revolution, notably for what was then the Manchester Guardian. Hugh was a stalwart of the Kipling Society, to which in 1998 he gave an address on Kipling and the Great War, and he explored the author’s work in Mowgli’s Sons: Kipling and Baden-Powell’s Scouts (1987). Born in Oxford, Hugh was the son of Denis, at the time a fellow of Corpus Christi College, and Olwen (nee Kendall), an archaeologist whose work on a site associated with the Gaulish chieftain Vercingetorix led to that name becoming one of Hugh’s middle ones. At Repton school, Derbyshire, he began to develop his artistic and acting talents; he was disappointed not to complete the final chapter of the history of the school that it commissioned him to write. From there he went to St John’s College, Cambridge, where he gained a history degree (1959) and was a fellow (1964-74). His fiercest loyalty was to the University of Essex, where he then taught, from 1992 as professor, until retiring in 1998. He never lost his belief in the importance of undergraduate teaching, never presuming that he knew more than his students. For instance, in 1966 he joined one student, Ira Katznelson, future president of the American Social Science Research Council, in reading Hegel’s Philosophy of Right in their supervisions, as Katznelson remembered, a “mutual exploration of a difficult text”. By complete contrast, at Essex Hugh sometimes taught a course on American musical theatre. When Hugh came to visit, he was always collecting epigraphs from gravestones and memorials, copying them in his immaculate hand in a small notebook that always went with him. His partner, Hugh Tulloch, wrote with great authority on Bryce and Lord Acton, those Victorian figures so well-known to Hugh and his father, and on the debate in Britain on the American civil war. They were together for more than four decades, until Tulloch’s death in 2016. • Denis Hugh Vercingetorix Brogan, historian, born 20 March 1936; died 26 July 2019"
https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2019/apr/13/guardian-culture-critics-art-truth,"The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones and its deputy music editor, Laura Snapes, discuss the life of reviewing in the digital age Jonathan Jones and 
Laura Snapes Sat 13 Apr 2019 08.00 BST Jonathan Jones is the Guardian’s art critic. Here he recalls interviewing Yoko Ono and finding the tape recorder had failed, causing a stir over the Tower of London poppies, tracing the footsteps of Caravaggio, and swimming in the Med with Tracey Emin If you don’t think art is as important as politics, healthcare, education or any of the other topics that newspapers cover, you have probably never got on the wrong side of the power-brokers who think it is, and that they are too. Being an art critic for this paper is not like being one on any other. I regularly meet my opposite numbers and they often seem to have genteel working lives that are as predictable as a Sunday afternoon in Surbiton. Writing for the Guardian has never been like that. In all the time I have been involved, it has been reinventing journalism in surprising, occasionally shocking ways that bring fresh writing challenges, from reporting and interviewing to quickfire commentary, epic special features – and sometimes even straightforward reviews. From writing up an interview with Yoko Ono on a plane back from Bilbao to file the moment I landed and finding the tape recorder had failed, to causing such horror in the Conservative press with a bad review of the Tower of London poppies that David Cameron ended up being asked about it at prime minister’s questions, it’s a full and varied working life. And, obviously, a very fortunate one. How do you become a professional art critic? Having known a few, I’d say we all stumbled into it. The bottom line, though, is that “quality” newspapers publish critics. And if they didn’t, there would not really be anywhere at all where regular, readable, up-to-the-minute art commentary existed. Art magazines address a specialist audience and academia has its own idiom. Still, the question at the top returns – in a troubled age for newspapers, do they really need to cover art when the resources could go to politics, healthcare, education and global news? The answer, I think, is right there in the varied roles in which I’ve written about art in the Guardian. Always, I’ve found art entangling itself with the raw reality of our world. A few years ago I visited Vienna to interview Waqas Khan, an artist from Lahore whose abstract drawings I love. After chatting to him I walked to my hotel, only to find the entire old city blocked off by shield-bearing police protecting the far-right Freedom party ball from – totally invisible – “leftwing violence”. Two Europes, one of openness, the other of the rising far right, were juxtaposed and it was art that led me to the battle lines. This autumn I returned to a Vienna where the Freedom party is now in Austria’s ruling coalition to see an exhibition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Art, properly seen and felt, is about truth. I love reading about good art in a newspaper because there is redemption in our ability to turn from the terror, the mayhem and also the trivia of current events to contemplate the human condition as it is portrayed by serious artists. Art not only has a place in the news, it can deepen what news is. The job of an art critic, as I see it, is to point to this art that matters that can raise us out of the banal to see everything afresh. My most rewarding Guardian experience was a pilgrimage in which I traced the works and wanderings of Caravaggio for a piece that filled a whole edition of G2. To put his shocking, confrontational art right at the centre of a great national newspaper for a day felt political to me – a blast of truth. Another art journey I made for the paper was to Orkney, to see an exhibition by the video artist Bill Viola at the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness. Watching Viola’s film of a diver appearing to lose consciousness and individuality in stygian blue depths, while sitting suspended above the icy sea near the sunken battleships of Scapa Flow, reminded me that art still has the ability to touch those human depths. A different kind of immersive encounter was when I went swimming in the Mediterranean with Tracey Emin and she claimed she’d lured me out there to drown me in revenge for harsh Guardian reviews. I’ve been fascinated by the power of arts journalism ever since I first read the Guardian as a teenager. I got my dad to subscribe to it when I was studying for my A-levels in the early 1980s. Again and again I was drawn to the reviews. Why was it so interesting to read reviews by Michael Billington of plays I was unlikely to see? Not light relief. It was somehow the opposite. In among the news of the day that would be chip-paper tomorrow, you had this guy writing about the meaning of King Lear or the significance of Harold Pinter. Online or in print, good newspapers are a civilising force. They don’t just report events, they open up a limitless cultural world and make it accessible to everyone who can read. The Guardian struck me as the most civilised of all newspapers back when I was a kid in Wrexham and I never wanted to write for any other. It still does, after two decades on the inside. And with the help of supporters I have faith it always will. Laura Snapes is the Guardian’s deputy music editor. Here, she discusses how criticism in her field has changed, the relationship between artists and their fans, and why armchair appraisal won’t cut it When people talk about the so-called good old days of music criticism, what they usually mean is there was money to burn. That money bought sizeable pages for critics to fill and the cool-by-proxy lifestyle of fancy press trips, and enabled the excess that has, for worse, defined much of music culture. This era is mourned in some quarters, although its demise, pegged to the millennial crumbling of the music industry itself, has only ever meant good things for criticism. I got my first real music journalism job in 2010. I jettisoned my degree to embrace a tanking profession in the middle of the recession. Obviously, my parents were thrilled. In those first few years, I think “excess” extended to a few European festival jollies and a bewildering amount of free lager that kept appearing in the office. The old high-rolling ways never returned in the subsequent decade, which meant that music criticism had to get better. Without cover of an exotic setting or cartoonish protagonists, the work had to speak for itself and justify its own existence, making writers more intellectually resourceful. As the purse strings tightened, a generation of more socially engaged writers also started coming through. They demanded more from music journalism than lazy adherence to the male-genius trope (as the assistant music editor of Gal-Dem, Natty Kasambala, said on a panel recently: “We worshipped men because they could play guitar?”), and the even lazier dismissals of musicians who didn’t conform to the straight, white, male standard. They led bottom-up change: editors from Tavi Gevinson’s teen-girl bible Rookie are now editors at Rolling Stone, and writers from the feminist blog Jezebel are now New Yorker staff writers. Their inclusive, engaged standards became, if not the norm, then culturally dominant enough that any publications that don’t conform to them tend to get a pasting online, at least. It’s as suspect to declare music criticism in rude health as it is to say it’s all gone to pot; you can’t praise the progressive values that inform the best stuff without noting how far there is to go regarding representation and fair compensation for writers. Facebook has attacked the business models of independent publications. The clip at which music culture moves means that many outlets are more interested in cheap clicks and instant reactions than giving writers time to develop their theories into thoughtful work. And when there is little money, and the media are being sidelined by artists who want to control their own narratives, publicists also command a degree of power that in some quarters can complicate honest coverage. The relationship between artists and fans on social media has also led to a degree of fan service masquerading as music journalism. What might look like setbacks are opportunities for music journalism to become more essential and for writers to emphasise a push towards work that endures: through close reads and careful balances of aesthetic and political consideration; and through questioning the market and technological dynamics that govern how music is shaped and sold, and what they mean for the musicians caught among them. As Jonathan writes, the work of a critic shouldn’t be armchair appraisal, but getting stuck into the fray and attempting to understand why the work we’re hearing is getting through the gatekeepers, who’s getting to make that work, under what circumstances, and what it reflects, rejects or critiques about how we live now. It’s the work music journalism should have been doing all along."

Last modified on Wed 28 Aug 2019 01.06 BST A former employee of Ladbrokes has told The Guardian that the company was aware for several months of an issue with its software systems that caused some customers to see unique “receipt” numbers, normally issued only when a bet has been accepted, on bets that had been refused by the firm’s trading department. The problem was not addressed immediately, however, due to concerns about the possible effect on profitability. The Guardian first reported an apparent problem with Ladbrokes’ procedures for accepting and refusing bets in November 2018. From October 2017 onwards clients whose bets were referred for approval by traders reported seeing receipt numbers alongside their requested stakes, while the balance of their account also appeared to have been debited as if the bet had been accepted, even though the traders had declined the bet. The bets were also subsequently listed on their account statements as having been “cancelled” rather than declined or refused. It subsequently emerged that a number of Ladbrokes’ customers had received out-of-court settlements after threatening to sue for payment on bets that they believed had been accepted, while several more had lodged cases with IBAS, the Independent Betting Adjudication Service. In December 2018 Ladbrokes issued a statement that said “following a thorough and forensic technical investigation”, the firm had identified a “technical glitch” that had caused the issue for a “very small number of punters”, and that it would be contacting these customers to “pay any winnings due‚“ on bets they might have believed had been accepted. However, the latest account of the problem by a former Ladbrokes employee suggests that Ladbrokes had been aware of the problem for many months. “It was on and off,” the former employee says. “They would rewrite the code and upload it and it would be fine, then another upload would break it. There was a six-week period leading up to one of the big race meetings where they couldn’t change anything. “Customers were asking for big bets and seeing an open bet ID, so they think they’re on. For a lot of them it went their way [as the bets would have been losers] but that’s not the point. If the customer thinks that they’re on and they’re not, that’s such poor customer service. “They knew that, if they were rejecting bets, the customers were seeing it as an accepted bet. Whatever the outcome of the [trading] decision, the customer was getting an open bet ID. “There was meeting after meeting saying, what can we do? They could have upped the limits [so that more bets were accepted without referral] but that would have had an impact on profitability. At one point we were getting 30 or 40 emails a day from people asking why bets hadn’t been paid. When you’re a major plc listed on the FTSE, that kind of thing shouldn’t be happening.” Lingfield 2.00 Maroon Bells 2.30 Mustadun 3.00 Lazarus 3.30 More Than Likely 4.00 Follia 4.30 Mr Kodi 5.00 Napping Musselburgh 2.10 Imperial Gloriana 2.40 Holmeswood (nap) 3.10 The Grey Zebedee 3.40 Firsteen (nb) 4.10 Catch My Breath 4.40 Uptown Funk 5.10 Three Castles Catterick 2.20 Ruby Wonder 2.50 Robert Fitzroy 3.20 Narak 3.50 Luis Vaz De Torres 4.20 Dante’s View 4.55 Seamster 5.25 Naadirr Worcester 4.45 Alexander The Grey 5.15 Wolfcatcher 5.45 Crystal Gazing 6.15 Jen’s Boy 6.45 Hummdinger 7.15 Bathiva 7.45 Milan Of Crystal Kempton Park 5.55 National Treasure 6.25 Mutasaamy 6.55 Khabeerah 7.25 Swansdown 7.55 Zzoro 8.25 Blame It On Sally 8.55 Lordsbridge Boy Several IBAS cases linked to Ladbrokes’ cancelled bets issue were closed in December after the firm said that it would pay out customers who had been affected, but one remains outstanding and could yet lead to an official IBAS ruling on the affair. It is unclear as yet why this case has not been settled. Ladbrokes did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday."
